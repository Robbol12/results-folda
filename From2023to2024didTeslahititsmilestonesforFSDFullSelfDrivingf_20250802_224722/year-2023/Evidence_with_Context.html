Elon Musk

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Call Starts Abruptly<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">beta, and that number is growing rapidly.</span>
    We recently completed a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> GPU cluster of H100s.
    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
    Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some 
certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
    It must have a lead car in plains, only <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> miles per hour.
    Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
    But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</span>

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?

    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> -- roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> connectors and over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.</span>
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.
