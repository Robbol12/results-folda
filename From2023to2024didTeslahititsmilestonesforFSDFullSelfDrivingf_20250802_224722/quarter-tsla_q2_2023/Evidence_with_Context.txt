[TSLA_Q2_2023] From 2023 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #416] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today.
     Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week.
     If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish.
     If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
     Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
     The value is just tremendous.
     So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
>>> I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next analyst.
     The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.

Two questions from me as well.
     First, following up on the autonomy.
     So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD incrementally.
     What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates?

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
     The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
     So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
     And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
     But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves.
     Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
     That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

     Some other highlights.
     Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations.
     As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the North American Charging Standard.
     We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network.
     We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general.
     So, that’s the goal there.
     Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies.
>>> And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
     So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
     We’re more than happy to license it to others.
     And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
     Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to come.
     Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
     And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
