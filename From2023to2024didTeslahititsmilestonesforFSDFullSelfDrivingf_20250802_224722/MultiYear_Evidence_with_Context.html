<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">beta, and that number is growing rapidly.</span>
    We recently completed a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> GPU cluster of H100s.
    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.

    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.
    So we’ll have to wait till August.
    The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.

    Just a couple more.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
    Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some 
certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
    It must have a lead car in plains, only <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> miles per hour.
    Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
    But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, it&#x27;s really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
    But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car --
allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to
intervene or were little concerned.
    But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
    And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">full self-driving technology.</span>
    What we&#x27;ve generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
    And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference 
computer.
    That&#x27;s better than us selling CAD drawings.
    And then we&#x27;re only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the 
complexity.
    And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we 
obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
    I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that 
unless you have FSD, you&#x27;re dead.

    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</span>

    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> -- roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> connectors and over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.</span>
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.

    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.

    And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.

    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span> of FSD is going out soon.
    will elaborate more on that later in the call.
    We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>.
    And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three 
orders of magnitude.
    So, that&#x27;s a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it&#x27;s next -- it </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">seems extremely likely to be next year.</span>
    Ashok, do you want to say anything?
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
    Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 10<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> improvement with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> from 
starting of this year and then with v13 release.
    We expect to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,00<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
    And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also 
helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

Yes.
    Good afternoon.
    Thanks very much for taking the question.
    The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not 
really been believing in it.
    Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.
    And I think it is.
    I think we&#x27;ve now with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.3</span>, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a 
relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving.
    No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
    Vaibhav Taneja

No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.

    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
    This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- 
not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.

    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> has 5x the parameters of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.4</span> and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.
    So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
    So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>, we are finally merged the two stacks.
    I still find that most people actually don&#x27;t know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand
the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
    One of the things we&#x27;re going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car 
is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them
around the block.
    Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
    So it&#x27;s very compelling.

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.

Yes, I can take it.

    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.
    We’re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> to kind of extend 
some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade.
    So it’s a playbook that we’ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This is a question we get asked a lot.
    So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
    This is a onetime amnesty.
    So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within 
reasonable delivery time frames.
    So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
    This is a onetime thing.

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, and maybe a </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.

    Elon Musk

With respect to Roadster, we&#x27;ve completed most of the engineering.
    And I think there&#x27;s still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next 
year.

Fantastic.
    The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we&#x27;ve already covered.
    So we&#x27;ll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">self-driving.</span>
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
    I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
    So next year seems highly probable to me based on  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
    That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.

    Yes, the future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that&#x27;s for sure.
    We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history.
    So, yes, so the proof is in the pudding.
    So, we&#x27;re going to be launching unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.
    So, I talked to the team.
    We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in 
Austin in June.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We already have Teslas operating autonomously unsupervised full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we&#x27;ll </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">soon be doing that at our factory in Texas.</span>
    So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California, that we&#x27;ll 
soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world, the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.
    And the cars aren&#x27;t just driving to exactly the same spot because, obviously, they want to collide at the same spot.
    The cars are actually programmed with where -- with what lane they need to park into to be picked up for delivery.
    So, the drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking spot and to be picked up for delivery to 
customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day.
    It&#x27;s pretty cool.
    Like I said, these Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them in June in Austin.
    So, what I&#x27;m saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation.

    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicles in North America.

    And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our

training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, to date, over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">300</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.</span>
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
    With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production
line in Austin.

    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I&#x27;m making here are going to be pretty accurate.
    And it&#x27;s worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon&#x27;s always late.
    Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I&#x27;m late but never reports when I&#x27;m early.
    So, sure, I&#x27;m optimistic but I&#x27;m not that optimistic.
    There are many cases in past where actually we&#x27;ve been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the 
factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
    So, yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m very confident we&#x27;ll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">North America, at least.</span>
    I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it&#x27;s likely to be just regulatory.
    Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs 
to be addressed.
    This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
    So, guys, there&#x27;s too many reps in the field.
    For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we 
have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
    Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
    And there&#x27;s like this EU country committee.

    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full </span>

    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicles in North America.

    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
    It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras 
and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> on in North America.

    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.

    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, if not late this year.

    Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
    Out of necessity, we&#x27;ve actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> at
