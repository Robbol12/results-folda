[TSLA_Q2_2024] From 2023 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #167] [UNCERTAIN]
     And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you.
     Just a couple more.
>>> Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

2. [Sentence #54] [UNCERTAIN]
     For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
     So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
     So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
     We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
     The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
     I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
>>> Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
     And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
     ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
     And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
     I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.

     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
>>> It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.
     With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
     But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
     And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thanks very much.
     And now we will move on to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
