I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.

    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.
    So we’ll have to wait till August.
    The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
    We already talked about that.

    And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the high volume version of Optimus 
will also be produced here in Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you.
    Just a couple more.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.

    So, it&#x27;s really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
    But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car --
allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to
intervene or were little concerned.
    But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
    And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">full self-driving technology.</span>
    What we&#x27;ve generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
    And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference 
computer.
    That&#x27;s better than us selling CAD drawings.
    And then we&#x27;re only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the 
complexity.
    And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we 
obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
    I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that 
unless you have FSD, you&#x27;re dead.

    With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
    But I&#x27;m certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
    And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla&#x27;s software, yes.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thanks very much.
