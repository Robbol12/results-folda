1. [Sentence #211] [SCALE ACHIEVED]

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.

Okay.
     Thank you.
>>> The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
     Elon already talked about that.
     So we’ll have to wait till August.
