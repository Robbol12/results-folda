[TSLA_Q1_2019] Model-y delivery

1. [Sentence #407] [PLAN]
     First one, on customer deposits, it looks like it’s essentially flat to maybe slightly down.
     I understand it’s probably some timing with deliveries that could have helped it towards the end of the quarter.
     But we would have thought it would have increased given the Model Y [indiscernible].
     So, our question is what was the initial order intake for the Model Y?
     And just coming through combing some of your comment earlier, what daily order rate are you seeing right now for the rest of your products?
     Elon Musk

I think we don’t want to comment on the granularity of deposits.
     Again, people read too much into this.
>>> We’re not playing of the Model Y because we’re just not in production so you can’t really read anything into Model Y orders at this point.
     David Tambourino

Okay.
     Well, then my second question would just be if you anticipate a further price adjustment the next level view credit phasing out July 1?
     Elon Musk

We don’t comment on future price changes unless you see it publicly.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
