[TSLA_Q3_2019] Model-y delivery

1. [Sentence #251] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     DeepScale is a very tiny company.
     It's basically about 12 people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
     So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly accelerate FSD.
     That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
     Yeah.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
>>> The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
     So we'll jump to the third question from Craig.
     News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.
     Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga 3?
     And confirm purpose of the second building now being built.
     Is that for battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
     Elon Musk

Yeah, we're in trial production of Model 3, basically sending cars through the system, and we're ramping rapidly.
     We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
