achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

    But what’s sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we have long-term contracts with 
suppliers, but those long-term contracts will obviously run out and then the year we’ll start to see potentially 
significant cost increases.
    But the macro is sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition
to sustainable energy faster?
    It’s fundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output -- at what 
rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year?
    That is the fundamental limiting factor.
    So, in order -- and that will move as fast as the slowest, least lucky element of the whole supply chain.
    Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium.
    And it’s not that -- to be clear, it’s not that there’s a shortage of lithium ore in the world.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Lithium is present almost everywhere.</span>
    It’s a very common element.
    However, you still need to take up the ore -- take up basically sludge or whatever the clay with the lithium and 
then you need to go through a whole series of refinement steps.
    And that’s a lot of industrial equipment that’s needed to refine lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium 
hydroxide or lithium carbonate in the battery cell.
    So, we think we’re going to need to help the industry on this front, but the -- I mean, the industry is very fast.
    And I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get into the lithium 
business.
    The lithium margins right now are practically software margins.
    I mean, if the -- I think it’s something -- I think there’s a -- I mean, -- correct me if I’m wrong, but I think 
we’re seeing cases where the spot lithium price is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times higher than the cost of extraction.

    And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are 
thinking about these things.
    And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    One thing I want to call out is like we’re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories.
    We’re recycling <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> with all of that reclaimed material going 
directly back into our cathode supply chain.
    So, we’re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
    Elon Musk

And that’s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop.</span>
    We regrind any plastic figures out.
    And so, we’re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get 
them in the door, using all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% of them.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    No, that’s a great point.
    So, we’re storing -- we’re installing sort of furnaces  for probably for aluminum like sort for the Model Y that 
we’ve built here in Giga Texas has both a front and a rear body casting.
    So, we’re casting almost two-thirds of the body.
    It’s high pressure die cast aluminum.

    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Optimus robot program.</span>
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
    Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car
business, worth more than FSD.
    That’s my firm belief.
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
    And basically, the future is very exciting.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">374</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we’ll adjust accordingly.
    But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> 
months from now.
    So, this is our best guess.
    Andrew Baglino

But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
    So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as 
quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their 
willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And that’s similar to what we’ve done with everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">be done.</span>
    And so, like we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition.
    And affordability is a goal because it’s unaffordable.
    It’s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can’t have that as an outcome.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thanks.
    Can you hear me well?

    It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the 
cathode.
    So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
    So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total 
amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.

Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s First Quarter <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Q&amp;A Webcast.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">of other executives.</span>
    Our Q1 results were announced at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this 
webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.
    Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Zach will have some opening remarks.

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any 
other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
    Elon Musk

I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.
    Lars Moravy

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it
takes all the long-term impact.
    So, we really have -- like we don’t have the door reinforcements.
    We don’t have the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>.
    So, to your point, I haven’t counted them because I don’t often look back at old technologies to decide how well I’m
doing.
    I check that once in a while.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count.</span>
    I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% less.
    Elon Musk

All right.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Elon Musk

Do we expect to expand?
    Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada.
    There’s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest 
increase in output will be from Giga Texas.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.</span>
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.

    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and </span>

    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.

    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
    Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple
of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&quot;real&quot;</span> improvement.
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.

    So, this is something we think about quite a lot.
    It depends what extreme size means.
    But certainly looking at, like, say, the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> million, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> million, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million 
vehicle levels, you really have to analyze the sort of macroeconomic, just like what is the tonnage of lithium that you 
need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes.
    It looks like really you think of like just macro tonnage.
    And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we want to -- what are limiting 
factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future.
    And whatever the most limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors.
    So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is 
responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s I think the single biggest cost growth item right now certainly on a percentage basis.</span>
    Although just for those who don’t totally know this, the actual content of lithium in lithium ion cell is maybe 
around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>% of the cell, so.
    Andrew Baglino

    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> kg.
    It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the 
cathode.
    So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
    So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total 
amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.

Thank you.
    At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai?
    Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?
    Elon Musk

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.
    And we’ve now gone through the -- we have basically veteran teams that obviously in the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y ramp -- Y ramp 
especially in multiple locations.
    And we’re obviously sharing what we’ve learned.
    And so, we don’t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, 
and we have done a lot to simplify the production prices of Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas 
and Berlin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.</span>
    Andrew Baglino

But we also had a structural casting, about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% less robots, we expect to almost double the capacity for body, for 
example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our capacity in a lot of areas.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Right.
    The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack and front and rear castings, the body 
shop size drops by over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% relative to the standard way of making a car.
    Andrew Baglino

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> general assembly or everything else because, we have the structural battery, the floor is the

    We put the seats on the battery and then we put that in the cars.

    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
    Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt architecture probably, but it 
really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts.
    And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
    Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
    Elon Musk

$<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Sorry.</span>
    $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    It’s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe
it’s been whittled away to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> or less.
    On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to
the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more 
semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage.
    And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck.
    But for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y platform where we’ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.
    Elon Musk

    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
    Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car
business, worth more than FSD.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; That’s my firm belief.</span>
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
    And basically, the future is very exciting.
    I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.

    So just a Q1 recap.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and higher margin.</span>
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.

    And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
    With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
    And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.
    Elon Musk

And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in 
Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is 
affecting my insurance rate or it isn’t.
    And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my 
driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for 
safer driving and an incentive to do so.
    So, it is -- actually, what we’re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is 
also net good.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon’s point, and premiums are lower.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.</span>
    And I think I’ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these 
benefits.
    It’s bigger than just the economics.
    We’re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency.
    It’s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see 
exactly what that caused.
    And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability
of that accident.

    On the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
    For the smaller platform vehicles like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, there’s some wins and losses with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts, not everything is 
better.
    And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but 
there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
    It’s really about mass and power.
    And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
    Basically, our estimate is that going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts might save $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not really moving the needle.</span>
    Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
    It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">110</span>-volt household power -- or voltage.
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">21</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you’re seeing and that you’re 
going to need additional pricing as well in addition to those specific initiatives that you’ve called out?
    Elon Musk

We hope we don’t need to increase the pricing further.
    The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs.
    And if those growth -- if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actually may slightly reduce prices.
    So, should we currently anticipate making significant price increases.
    But obviously, we don’t control the macroeconomic environment.
    If governments keep printing vast amounts of money and if there’s -- if there are not significant increases in 
lithium extraction and refinement and other raw materials, such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw 
materials, then obviously, that will drive prices to high levels.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we’ll adjust accordingly.</span>
    But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> 
months from now.
    So, this is our best guess.
    Andrew Baglino

But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
    So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as 
quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their 
willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand.
    And that’s similar to what we’ve done with everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to
be done.

    Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to add to what Elon is saying, there’s different ways to calculate raw material exposure.
    I think the simple way, we estimate we’re around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials.
    And just to clarify a couple of things on that.
    So, we’ve been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a number of quarters now.
    That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what we’re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.</span>
    And as indices move, it doesn’t impact us immediately or directly.
    In some cases, we have contracts with suppliers.
    But then as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can be a lag.
    In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or raw material prices.
    But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as well based on the contract.
    And so, to Elon’s point, what we’re trying to do here, because it’s quite an unprecedented situation of raw material
movement and all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts, is we’re trying to anticipate 
where things will go and make sure the pricing that we have put in place at the time that those raw material cost 
increases hit us that they align and that the company can remain financially healthy in various scenarios as we look out
over the next four quarters.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just a Q1 recap.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.</span>
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
    With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger 
capacity is really important.
    And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    Mark Delaney

Okay.
    That’s helpful.
    And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out 
in more states.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?</span>
    And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
    Maybe one step that I’ll share.
    So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
    But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
    And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.

    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
    And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
    Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our </span>

    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
    Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating 
margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.

really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts.

    On the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
    For the smaller platform vehicles like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, there’s some wins and losses with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts, not everything is 
better.
    And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but 
there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
    It’s really about mass and power.
