Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Call Starts Abruptly<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and that number is growing rapidly.</span>

    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.
    So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.
    But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to 
necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where 
the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
    And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.
    And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a 
very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level.
    So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available 
and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly 
astounding in a positive way.
    When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> hours of usage per week.
    That’s -- if you drive <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span>-hour a day on average, that’s roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week out of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">168</span> hours.
    And then there’s also you’re going to have parking and insurance.
    You got to take care of the car.
    It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do not create some variance of the terminator outcome.
    So, we’re going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot.
    So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can’t change that, even if you put -- like a 
software update, you can’t change that.
    It has to be hard-coded.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.</span>
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
    Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some

    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> -- roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> connectors and over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.</span>
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.

    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</span>

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.
    And I’m saying that would be in the U.S. because we’ve got to focus on one market first.
    But I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    I’ve been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the price of FSD -- so the great thing is the price of FSD is actually very low, it’s not high.</span>
    When you go back to what I said earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous.
    $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> is actually a low price, not a high price.
    And we will offer -- and we -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most 
people don’t know that.
    So, I’d recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don’t have to go with the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> thing.
    But I think yes, yes -- obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> is actually a low 
price for FSD.

And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.
    William Stein

I’d like to ask about -- to stick on this AI topic.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features as we transition technologies.</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.
    We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support 
the overall demand.
    There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market.
    First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y,
which means an immediate reduction of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> at the time of purchase to the end customer.
    Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.
    Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales.
    Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by 
more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our 
Megafactory in Lathrop.
    I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.
    Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our 
fleet grows.
    As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
    For <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing 
investments in our future growth initiatives.
    Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> to be in excess of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> billion.
    We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our 
computer, if they did not have the training data.
    So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net 
training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
    And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> exaflops by the end of next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, to date, over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">300</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.</span>
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
    With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production
line in Austin.
