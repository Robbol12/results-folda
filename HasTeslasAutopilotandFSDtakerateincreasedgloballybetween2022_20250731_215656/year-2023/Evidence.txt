--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #40]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Regarding **Autopilot** and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
2. [Sentence #59]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain **Autopilot** features as we transition technologies.
3. [Sentence #223]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your **FSD** **take** rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there?
4. [Sentence #226]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the **FSD** ****take** **rate****, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
5. [Sentence #630]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using **FSD** beta.
6. [Sentence #652]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla **FSD**.
7. [Sentence #1001]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
8. [Sentence #1009]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of **FSD**?
9. [Sentence #1020]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And the price of **FSD** -- so the great thing is the price of **FSD** is actually very low, it’s not high.
10. [Sentence #1151]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Regarding **Autopilot** and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with **FSD** beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
11. [Sentence #1302]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) The next question is, why was the price dropped on **FSD** if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
12. [Sentence #1304]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Yes, I think, over time, the price of **FSD** will increase proportionate to its value.
13. [Sentence #1308]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for **FSD**?
14. [Sentence #1396]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And so I’m wondering how you **take** that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of **FSD** over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
15. [Sentence #1732]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth **rate** in 2024.
