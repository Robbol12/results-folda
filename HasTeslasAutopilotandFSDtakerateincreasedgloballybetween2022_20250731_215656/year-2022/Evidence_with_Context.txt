[Year 2022] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2022 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

1. [Sentence #2027, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
     So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
     I'm just guessing here.
     So, this is -- that would be my guess.
     Pierre Ferragu

Thank you, so much.
     So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout.
     And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today?
>>> So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the take rate?
     Elon Musk

The trend is very strong towards use of FSD.
     And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases.
     And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies.
     This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
     With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, five years old from the design point.
     And Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that, where there are significant leaps.
     And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.

3. [Sentence #584, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PILOT]
     And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000 vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next few months.
     To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the 2170 cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call.
     But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year.
     So we are not dependent on 4680.
     4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
     That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas.
     And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
>>> Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.
     They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.
     We have now driven over 35 million miles with FSD beta.
     That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than any – all other companies combined.
     So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
     With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage.
     We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
     And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.

4. [Sentence #1009, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO [ph], and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
     But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
     And so that’s why I am confident we will get to 5,000 cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin, go ahead please.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
>>> Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
     I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it.
     Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
     The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
     It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
     Colin Rusch

Great.

5. [Sentence #527, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
     With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
     And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.
     Elon Musk

And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is affecting my insurance rate or it isn’t.
     And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for safer driving and an incentive to do so.
     So, it is -- actually, what we’re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is also net good.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon’s point, and premiums are lower.
>>> We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.
     And I think I’ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these benefits.
     It’s bigger than just the economics.
     We’re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency.
     It’s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see exactly what that caused.
     And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident.

6. [Sentence #2050, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes

Alex Potter

Okay, great.
     So a quick one on FSD.
     This, I guess, for Zach.
     Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
     But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
>>> There's enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
     We fully recognize that.
     Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we've released a portion of that.
     And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there.
     And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.
     Alex Potter

Okay, great.
     And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning.
     That's a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi.

7. [Sentence #1258, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

8. [Sentence #507, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
     With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger capacity is really important.
     And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     Mark Delaney

Okay.
     That’s helpful.
     And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out in more states.
>>> Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?
     And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
     Thank you.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
     Maybe one step that I’ll share.
     So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
     But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
     And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.

     Colin Rusch

Great.
     And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
     But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues with as you move into production?

11. [Sentence #119, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     And then, Model 3.
     It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start of production.
     So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
     But to get to sort of the 5,000 a week level has typically taken us around 12 months from start of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
     Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
>>> Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long.
     And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
     So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware of and believe will happen over the next 6 to 12 months.
     So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year from now.
     So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
     We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.
     Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
-----
12. [Sentence #76, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
     And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.
     And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program.
     The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
>>> Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD.
     That’s my firm belief.
     So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
     We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
     So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
     And basically, the future is very exciting.
     I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
     Thank you.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
     At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
-----
14. [Sentence #1789, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
-----
15. [Sentence #186, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let’s go to the next question.
     Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     We’re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all the commodity costs.
     So, that’s an exception I needed to call out.
>>> Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve discussed is achieved.
     Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial 4680 and structural battery ramps.
     And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and higher-range structural pack provisions.
     Elon Musk

I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will be competitive with the best alternatives later this year.
     And we think we’ll exceed the best alternatives next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean we have some good existing proofs, right?
     Like we’ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.
