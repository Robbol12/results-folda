profitability from FSD as predicted?

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next 
few months.
    To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
questions later in this call.
    But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of 
the year.
    So we are not dependent on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
    That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas.
    And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> owners.</span>
    They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.
    We have now driven over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span> million miles with FSD beta.
    That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than 
any – all other companies combined.
    So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
    With regard to manufacturing and technology, about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> years ago, we said we wanted to become the best 
manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our 
strongest competitive advantage.
    We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
    And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO , and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very
difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
    But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
    And so that’s why I am confident we will get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year

Thank you.
    The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
    Colin, go ahead please.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
    I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the 
caveats associated with that can use it.
    Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
    The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
    It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
    Colin Rusch

Great.

Great.
    And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
    But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the
elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly 
around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues 
with as you move into production?
