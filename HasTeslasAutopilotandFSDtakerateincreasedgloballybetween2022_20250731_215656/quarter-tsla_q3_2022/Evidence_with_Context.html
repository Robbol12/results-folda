    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.

    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
    But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
    Yes.
    At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
