    And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
    With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
    And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.
    Elon Musk

And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in 
Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is 
affecting my insurance rate or it isn’t.
    And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my 
driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for 
safer driving and an incentive to do so.
    So, it is -- actually, what we’re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is 
also net good.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon’s point, and premiums are lower.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.</span>
    And I think I’ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these 
benefits.
    It’s bigger than just the economics.
    We’re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency.
    It’s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see 
exactly what that caused.
    And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability
of that accident.

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
    With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger 
capacity is really important.
    And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    Mark Delaney

Okay.
    That’s helpful.
    And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out 
in more states.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?</span>
    And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
    Maybe one step that I’ll share.
    So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
    But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
    And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.

    And then, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>
to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">vehicles is quite long.</span>
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
    So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware 
of and believe will happen over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.
    Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">business, worth more than FSD.</span>
    That’s my firm belief.
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
    And basically, the future is very exciting.
    I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
    Thank you.

Okay.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of 
expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    We’re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those
areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all 
the commodity costs.
    So, that’s an exception I needed to call out.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Similar to Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">discussed is achieved.</span>
    Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> and structural battery ramps.
    And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and 
higher-range structural pack provisions.
    Elon Musk

I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> and structural pack will be competitive with 
the best alternatives later this year.
    And we think we’ll exceed the best alternatives next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean we have some good existing proofs, right?
    Like we’ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.
