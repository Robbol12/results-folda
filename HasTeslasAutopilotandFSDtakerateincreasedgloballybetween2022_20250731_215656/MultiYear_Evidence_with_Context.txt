[Multi-Year Analysis] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2022 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

1. [Sentence #344, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     But what’s sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we have long-term contracts with suppliers, but those long-term contracts will obviously run out and then the year we’ll start to see potentially significant cost increases.
     But the macro is sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition to sustainable energy faster?
     It’s fundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output -- at what rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year?
     That is the fundamental limiting factor.
     So, in order -- and that will move as fast as the slowest, least lucky element of the whole supply chain.
     Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium.
     And it’s not that -- to be clear, it’s not that there’s a shortage of lithium ore in the world.
>>> Lithium is present almost everywhere.
     It’s a very common element.
     However, you still need to take up the ore -- take up basically sludge or whatever the clay with the lithium and then you need to go through a whole series of refinement steps.
     And that’s a lot of industrial equipment that’s needed to refine lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate in the battery cell.
     So, we think we’re going to need to help the industry on this front, but the -- I mean, the industry is very fast.
     And I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get into the lithium business.
     The lithium margins right now are practically software margins.
     I mean, if the -- I think it’s something -- I think there’s a -- I mean, -- correct me if I’m wrong, but I think we’re seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10 times higher than the cost of extraction.

2. [Sentence #226, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about these things.
     And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     One thing I want to call out is like we’re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories.
     We’re recycling 50 tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to 150 with all of that reclaimed material going directly back into our cathode supply chain.
     So, we’re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
     Elon Musk

And that’s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries.
>>> But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop.
     We regrind any plastic figures out.
     And so, we’re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get them in the door, using all 100% of them.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     No, that’s a great point.
     So, we’re storing -- we’re installing sort of furnaces [ph] for probably for aluminum like sort for the Model Y that we’ve built here in Giga Texas has both a front and a rear body casting.
     So, we’re casting almost two-thirds of the body.
     It’s high pressure die cast aluminum.
-----
3. [Sentence #343, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     But what’s sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we have long-term contracts with suppliers, but those long-term contracts will obviously run out and then the year we’ll start to see potentially significant cost increases.
     But the macro is sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition to sustainable energy faster?

     The lithium margins right now are practically software margins.

4. [Sentence #74, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PLAN]
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
     And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.
>>> And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program.
     The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
     Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD.
     That’s my firm belief.
     So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
     We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
     So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
     And basically, the future is very exciting.
-----
5. [Sentence #374, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we’ll adjust accordingly.
     But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like 6 to 12 months from now.
     So, this is our best guess.
     Andrew Baglino

But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
     So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Andrew Baglino

And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand.
>>> And that’s similar to what we’ve done with everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to be done.
     And so, like we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition.
     And affordability is a goal because it’s unaffordable.
     It’s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can’t have that as an outcome.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

Thanks.
     Can you hear me well?

6. [Sentence #223, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the cathode.
     So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
     So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.
     And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about these things.
     And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.

Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s First Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast.
>>> My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
     Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.
     Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks.
-----
8. [Sentence #424, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
     Elon Musk

I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.
     Lars Moravy

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it takes all the long-term impact.
     So, we really have -- like we don’t have the door reinforcements.
     We don’t have the [Technical Difficulty].
     So, to your point, I haven’t counted them because I don’t often look back at old technologies to decide how well I’m doing.
     I check that once in a while.
>>> But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count.
     I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably 20% to 30% less.
     Elon Musk

All right.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Elon Musk

Do we expect to expand?
     Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada.
     There’s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest increase in output will be from Giga Texas.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
-----
9. [Sentence #54, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
     So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
     They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
     And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
     So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus ‘21.
     I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
     So, let’s see.
>>> Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
     So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
     Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
-----
10. [Sentence #27, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
     Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
     Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
     Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
     We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
     The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
     Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
>>> OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items.
     As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%.
     Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April.
     These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars.
     Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production.
     Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
     Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
     First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
-----
11. [Sentence #452, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
     Alex Potter

Okay.
     Thanks.
     Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of "real" improvement.
     Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
     And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Musk

There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
     Colin Langan

Great.
     Do you guys hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Colin Langan

Perfect.
     Just to follow-up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, but obviously, it seems pretty important.
-----
12. [Sentence #211, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     So, this is something we think about quite a lot.
     It depends what extreme size means.
     But certainly looking at, like, say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5 million, 10 million, 20 million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze the sort of macroeconomic, just like what is the tonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes.
     It looks like really you think of like just macro tonnage.
     And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we want to -- what are limiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future.
     And whatever the most limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors.
     So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the sales.
>>> It’s I think the single biggest cost growth item right now certainly on a percentage basis.
     Although just for those who don’t totally know this, the actual content of lithium in lithium ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell, so.
     Andrew Baglino

5 kgs a car.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     5 kg.
     It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the cathode.
     So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
     So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.
-----
13. [Sentence #247, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai?
     Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?
     Elon Musk

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.
     And we’ve now gone through the -- we have basically veteran teams that obviously in the 3/Y ramp -- Y ramp especially in multiple locations.
     And we’re obviously sharing what we’ve learned.
     And so, we don’t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, and we have done a lot to simplify the production prices of Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas and Berlin.
>>> Yes.
     Andrew Baglino

But we also had a structural casting, about 30% less robots, we expect to almost double the capacity for body, for example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our capacity in a lot of areas.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Right.
     The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack and front and rear castings, the body shop size drops by over 60% relative to the standard way of making a car.
     Andrew Baglino

[Technical Difficulty] general assembly or everything else because, we have the structural battery, the floor is the battery.
     We put the seats on the battery and then we put that in the cars.
     So there’s actually 10% and 15% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly [Technical Difficulty].
-----
14. [Sentence #167, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And then, in your most -- like sort of 220.
     But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as they do in the U.S.
     So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
     Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an 800-volt architecture probably, but it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from 400 to 800 volts.
     And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
     Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that 100 volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
     Elon Musk

$100.
>>> Andrew Baglino

Sorry.
     $100.
     It’s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe it’s been whittled away to $50 or less.
     On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage.
     And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck.
     But for the 3/Y platform where we’ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It’s basically zero for robotaxi.
-----
15. [Sentence #77, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
     And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.
     And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program.
     The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
     Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD.
>>> That’s my firm belief.
     So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
     We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
     So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
     And basically, the future is very exciting.
     I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

16. [Sentence #576, TSLA_Q4_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So just a Q1 recap.
     Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States.
     And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
     So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
     The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
>>> We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
     Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
     As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.

18. [Sentence #580, TSLA_Q4_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]

     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
-----
19. [Sentence #527, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
     With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
     And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.
     Elon Musk

And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is affecting my insurance rate or it isn’t.
     And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for safer driving and an incentive to do so.
     So, it is -- actually, what we’re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is also net good.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon’s point, and premiums are lower.
>>> We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.
     And I think I’ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these benefits.
     It’s bigger than just the economics.
     We’re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency.
     It’s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see exactly what that caused.
     And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident.
-----
20. [Sentence #155, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
     For the smaller platform vehicles like 3 and Y, there’s some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better.
     And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
     It’s really about mass and power.
     And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
     Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
     Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save $100.
>>> It’s not really moving the needle.
     Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
     It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $100.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got 110-volt household power -- or voltage.
     And then, in your most -- like sort of 220.
     But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as they do in the U.S.
     So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.

     Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you’re seeing and that you’re going to need additional pricing as well in addition to those specific initiatives that you’ve called out?
     Elon Musk

We hope we don’t need to increase the pricing further.
     The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs.
     And if those growth -- if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actually may slightly reduce prices.
     So, should we currently anticipate making significant price increases.
     But obviously, we don’t control the macroeconomic environment.
     If governments keep printing vast amounts of money and if there’s -- if there are not significant increases in lithium extraction and refinement and other raw materials, such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials, then obviously, that will drive prices to high levels.
>>> So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we’ll adjust accordingly.
     But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like 6 to 12 months from now.
     So, this is our best guess.
     Andrew Baglino

But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
     So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Andrew Baglino

And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand.
     And that’s similar to what we’ve done with everything else, like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to be done.

     Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to add to what Elon is saying, there’s different ways to calculate raw material exposure.
     I think the simple way, we estimate we’re around 10% to 15% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials.
     And just to clarify a couple of things on that.
     So, we’ve been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a number of quarters now.
     That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter.
>>> And what we’re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.
     And as indices move, it doesn’t impact us immediately or directly.
     In some cases, we have contracts with suppliers.
     But then as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can be a lag.
     In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or raw material prices.
     But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as well based on the contract.
     And so, to Elon’s point, what we’re trying to do here, because it’s quite an unprecedented situation of raw material movement and all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts, is we’re trying to anticipate where things will go and make sure the pricing that we have put in place at the time that those raw material cost increases hit us that they align and that the company can remain financially healthy in various scenarios as we look out over the next four quarters.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.

23. [Sentence #583, TSLA_Q4_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
     Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
>>> As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.

     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So just a Q1 recap.
     Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States.
     And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
     So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
>>> The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
     With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger capacity is really important.
     And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     Mark Delaney

Okay.
     That’s helpful.
     And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out in more states.
>>> Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?
     And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
     Thank you.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
     Maybe one step that I’ll share.
     So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
     But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
     And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.

26. [Sentence #40, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
     First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
     Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
     This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
     Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
     And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
     Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
>>> We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 50% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
     Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%.
     This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.

     And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
     Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
     Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save $100.
     It’s not really moving the needle.
     Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
     It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $100.

     So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
     Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an 800-volt architecture probably, but it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from 400 to 800 volts.
     And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
     Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that 100 volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
     Elon Musk

$100.

29. [Sentence #153, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     And Drew, do you want to answer the 800-volt question?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, sure.
     On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
     For the smaller platform vehicles like 3 and Y, there’s some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better.
     And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
     It’s really about mass and power.
     And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
>>> Elon Musk

     Thanks.
     Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of "real" improvement.
     Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
     And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
     Colin Langan

Great.
     Do you guys hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Colin Langan

Perfect.
     Just to follow-up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, but obviously, it seems pretty important.
     How quickly can raw material supply be built?
     Because my understanding is it takes many years to build that out.
