[Year 2024] Has Teslaâ€™s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2022 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record **profitability** for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
2. [Sentence #28]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with **FSD** V12.
3. [Sentence #211]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing **FSD** in the future?
4. [Sentence #573]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Elon Musk

Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive **FSD** 12.3.
5. [Sentence #693]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised **FSD** essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
6. [Sentence #716]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Since the revision of **FSD** pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
7. [Sentence #806]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license **FSD**?
8. [Sentence #982]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised **FSD** in Europe, China, and other countries.
9. [Sentence #1013]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that **FSD** **take** rates were up materially after you reduced the price.
10. [Sentence #1200]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla **FSD** having longer miles between versions than human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it's next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year.
11. [Sentence #1220]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, the ****take** **rate**** for **FSD** has improved substantially, especially after the 10/10 event.
12. [Sentence #1306]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) We released **FSD** for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter.
13. [Sentence #1462]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) What will the next stage growth look like and when will **FSD** be ready?
14. [Sentence #1911]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the recognition of **FSD**-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
15. [Sentence #2313]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on **FSD**, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to **take** advantage of your tech advances?
16. [Sentence #2317]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, **Autopilot** Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with **FSD**?
17. [Sentence #2320]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on **FSD**?
