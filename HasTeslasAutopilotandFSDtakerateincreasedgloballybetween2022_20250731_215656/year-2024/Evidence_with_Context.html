    A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>
or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.
    So, you don&#x27;t expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
    A Cybercab looks different.
    A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> are -- look, they&#x27;re good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
    You don&#x27;t expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it 
does.
    So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we&#x27;re doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in 
the software, we&#x27;ll roll out another sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
    And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.

    Yes.

    We expect to achieve that next year with the -- with our existing vehicle line.
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

I wanted to actually spot someone gives a small taste of what it&#x27;s going to look like, the car able to drive itself to 
the user within private parking lots.
    Currently, it&#x27;s speed-limited, but then it&#x27;s going to quickly be increased.
    We already had more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion usage in terms of Smart Summon.

    And from what we understand, and again, maybe I&#x27;m wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in 
images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.
    Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn&#x27;t have pedal -- pedals or 
a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can&#x27;t make it work, not because the regulators, 
they&#x27;re blaming regulators.
    That&#x27;s misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.
    So it&#x27;s just that their technology is not far.
    George Gianarikas

Right.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">price.</span>
    Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly?
    Thank you.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, we shared the  that there we&#x27;ve seen a meaningful increase.
    I don&#x27;t want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results.
    And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can&#x27;t describe it till the time 
we actually use it.
    And that&#x27;s why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how 
this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is.
    I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there&#x27;s a bias example, but I have a more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> mile commute into

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.

    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.</span>
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
    Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping 
Cybertruck and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished 
goods.
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.

    will elaborate more on that later in the call.
    We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>.
    And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three 
orders of magnitude.
    So, that&#x27;s a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.

    Ashok, do you want to say anything?
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
    Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 10<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> improvement with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> from 
starting of this year and then with v13 release.
    We expect to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,00<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
    And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also 
helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

    So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more 
vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the question.
    We have a lot of cars.
    I mean, you&#x27;ve got millions of cars out there.
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">on FSD?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we&#x27;re trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
    And now Q1, we&#x27;ve got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.
    That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
    But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we&#x27;re talking that the executive team and I were talking about just 
before this call was we&#x27;ve got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one 
way or another.
    That&#x27;s the constraint on our output.

    Thank you.
    And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
    Ben, go ahead and unmute.
    Ben, you&#x27;re still muted.

    Let&#x27;s try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research.
    Final question.
    Shreyas Patil

Thanks so much.
    Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would 
decline by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> of COGS.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">982</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, and maybe a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.6</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.</span>
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.

the auto industry.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it&#x27;s underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
    And that&#x27;s why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people 
don&#x27;t realize that it has so much capability.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.

    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
    We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in 
the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span> and ramping really throughout the year 
to full production.
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.

    Thank you very much, Elon.
    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
    Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with 
generation of record operating cash flows of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.3</span> billion.
    Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
    While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing 
incentives.
    As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and 
recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">America, which contributed $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">326</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million of revenues in the quarter.</span>
    We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion of revenues so far this year.
    To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
    And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.
    As customers&#x27; acceptance of EV growth, we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling 
leads.
    Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory.
    To support this strategy, we&#x27;re continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in When you 
compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when 
you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, 
include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more.
    While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers 
but at times even with existing owners.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
    It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras 
and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> on in North America.
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we now have over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">300</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.</span>
    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.
    And as we&#x27;ve announced, we&#x27;ll be showcasing our purpose-built Robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August.
    Yes.

    As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro 
environment.
    We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
    For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who 
helped us achieve this.
    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.</span>
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
    All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.

    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
