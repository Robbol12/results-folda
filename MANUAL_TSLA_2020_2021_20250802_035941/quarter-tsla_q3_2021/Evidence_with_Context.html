    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.</span>
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

Okay.

    We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

Thank you very much.
    And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Very good quarter.
    I had two quick questions.
    First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
    Who are the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is related to Cybertruck.</span>
    Who is the supply looking at?
    If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I&#x27;ll say in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">23</span>-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span> time for Cybertruck?
    That&#x27;s all for me.
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    Sure.
    So obviously, as we&#x27;ve noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to 
meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
    With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.
