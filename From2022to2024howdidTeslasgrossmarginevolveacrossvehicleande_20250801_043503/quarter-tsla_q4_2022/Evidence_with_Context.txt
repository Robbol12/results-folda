[TSLA_Q4_2022] From 2022 to 2024, how did Tesla’s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

1. [Sentence #125] [PLAN]
     And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways.
     And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
     But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers.
     And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward.
     And so as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps.
     So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analyst released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models.
     Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?
     Elon Musk

Yes, go ahead, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I'll jump in on this.
     So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment.
     So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and rent credits and then $47,000 ASP across all models.
     And so two other comments I want to make on this.
     Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.

     Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
     And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
     As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022.
     But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
     The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is.
     And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.

     And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we're primarily managing to now.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
     So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.
>>> So that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin.
     And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
     And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
     That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
     Yeah.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next investor question.
     Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show…

Elon Musk

YouGov, crush that with your left.

     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap.
     It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
     It was our best year ever on every level.
     Team did an amazing job.
     It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
>>> So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
     While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.
     Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
     So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
     [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that.
     The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.
     Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
     Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.

     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
     This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
     As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
     In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
     Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
>>> This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
-----
8. [Sentence #416] [PLAN]
     And so we would guess, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.
     We are -- the Telsa China team is winning in China.
     And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China.
     So, hopefully, that continues.
     So, yes, so we're fired about the future and well, it's going to be great.
     George Gianarikas

Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles.
     You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline.
>>> Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help accelerate EV adoption?
     Elon Musk

Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I'm not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try.
     Yes, of course, of course.
     So, we actually look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles because if the -- for the longest time, we've been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output.
     And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market?
     Well, it doesn't really help if all you're doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another.
     In fact, it hurts because you add complexity, but you don't add incremental volume.
     So, it's sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability of lithium-ion batteries.
-----
9. [Sentence #107] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
     The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
>>> So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
