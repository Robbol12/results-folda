match their stated margin targets?

    And part of the work we&#x27;re doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as 
Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla&#x27;s plans anyways.
    And so I think we&#x27;re pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
    But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers.
    And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in 
our products going forward.
    And so as we&#x27;re thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were 
looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not 
only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> per car

    And so two other comments I want to make on this.
    Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
    As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we&#x27;re delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been
so long for so much of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
    The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we&#x27;re most focused on what our operating
margin is.
    And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing 
faster than the vehicle business and as we&#x27;re heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our 
overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don&#x27;t is 
that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled
and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
    So that&#x27;s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a 
small percentage of cars don&#x27;t have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that means that there&#x27;s millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% gross margin.</span>
    And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
    And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
    That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
    Yeah.

Thank you, Martin.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> -- just going through the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> recap.
    It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
    It was our best year ever on every level.
    Team did an amazing job.
    It&#x27;s an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, we delivered over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1.3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million cars and achieved a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% operating margin, the highest among any volume </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.</span>
    While doing so, we generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> billion in net income and $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7.5</span> billion in free cash flow.
    Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was an incredibly challenging year 
due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">90</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?

    And so we would guess, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.
    We are -- the Telsa China team is winning in China.
    And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China.
    So, hopefully, that continues.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re fired about the future and well, it&#x27;s going to be great.

Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles.
    You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">accelerate EV adoption?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I&#x27;m not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try.
    Yes, of course, of course.
    So, we actually look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles because if the -- for the longest time, 
we&#x27;ve been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output.
    And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market?
    Well, it doesn&#x27;t really help if all you&#x27;re doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another.
    In fact, it hurts because you add complexity, but you don&#x27;t add incremental volume.
    So, it&#x27;s sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability
of lithium-ion batteries.

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">700</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> per long-range Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">45</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?</span>
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
