    Ben Kallo

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">about the overall segments longer term?</span>
    And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% of your overall revenue?
    And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware.
    Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward 
customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean, as I&#x27;ve said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that 
Tesla combined.
    So, it&#x27;s simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything 
you ask of it.
    I think everyone on earth is going to want one.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We actually have enough with raw materials to take all of human civilization, make it fully sustainable and 
dramatically increased its trust usage would still be fully sustainable.
    One way to think of the progress of a civilization, this may sound a little esoteric, but is percentage completion 
of scale.
    So, <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Inaudible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> scale, one would be you&#x27;re using all the power of a planet.
    We&#x27;re currently less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>% on Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>.
    Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> would be using all the power of the sun, and Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, all of power of the galaxy, so we&#x27;ve got a long way to
go, long way to go.
    When you think of courtship terms, it becomes obvious that by far, the biggest source of energy is the sun.
    Everything else is in the.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI.</span>
    And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends.
    We think what we&#x27;re doing is the right approach.
    And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company 
in the world and probably by a long shot.
    I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we&#x27;re looking 
forward to building an incredibly exciting future.
    Thank you.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon.

And we do expect to roll out ride-hailing in California and Texas next year to the public.
    Now, California is somewhere -- there&#x27;s quite a long regulatory approval process.
    I think we should get approval next year but it&#x27;s contingent upon regulatory approval.
    Texas is a lot faster so it&#x27;s -- we&#x27;ll definitely have available in Texas and probably have it available in 
California, subject to regulatory approval.
    And then -- and maybe some other states actually next year as well, but at least California and Texas.
    So, I think that would be very exciting.
    That&#x27;s really a profound change.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle and a battery manufacturing company at that point.</span>
    So, we published Q3 vehicle safety report, which shows one crash for every <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> million miles of autopilot.
    That compares to the U.S. average of one crash roughly every <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">700</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> miles.
    So, it&#x27;s currently showing a 1<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> safety improvement relative to the U.S.

average.
    And we continue to expand our AI training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Optimus.
    We are currently not training compute-constrained.
    Probably the biggest limiting factor of the FSD is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually 
find mistakes.
    And when you start getting to where it can take <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> miles to find a mistake, it takes a while to actually figure

    Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">24.6</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    We expect the energy storage deployments for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> to grow at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">75</span>% higher from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
    Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our
control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
    On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future
projects, marketing, and other activities.
    We had negative free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> billion in the first quarter.
    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1337</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter.
    Note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory.
    Our pipeline and backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> production slots, and we are 
doing our best to keep up with the demand.
    Just coming back on automotive margins.
    I talked about -- sorry, I talked about what is happening.
    One other thing which I want to also share is that we&#x27;re seeing -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to,
like I said before, about squeezing of the cost.
    But this is something which we also are very capable of.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, just in Q3, we faced our lowest cost per vehicle, and that is a trend which we want to keep focused on.</span>
    Then going on to service and other.
    We continue to show improvements in Q3.
    This was a result of better performance, both in our service as well as it includes collision, part sales, and 
merchandise and continued growth in supercharging.
    These fee-based revenues will continue to grow as the overall fleet size increases.
    Our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter and on year-on-year basis.
    This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook in Q2.
    Cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts.
