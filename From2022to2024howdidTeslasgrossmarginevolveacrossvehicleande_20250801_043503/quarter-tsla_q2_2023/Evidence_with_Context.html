    Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
    As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence 
and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
    This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as
new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our 
R&amp;D spend.
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.</span>
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
    However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.

    I’m not recommending you to Tesla, but yes, buy low, sell high.
    Warren Buffett actually, I think has a saying -- I’m paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine
living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices 
at you, and it’s a different price every day.
    But the house is still the same house.
    So, this is a stock market.
    Credit that to Warren Buffett.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Where’s that crystal ball, again?
    If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the 
long-term picture.
    Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.
    I’d recommend looking at ARK Invest.
    I think their analysis is very good.
    It’s the best.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
