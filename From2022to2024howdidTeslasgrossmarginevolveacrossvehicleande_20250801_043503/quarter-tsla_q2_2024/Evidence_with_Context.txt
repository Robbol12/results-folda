[TSLA_Q2_2024] From 2022 to 2024, how did Teslaâ€™s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

     So, if you start announcing some great thing, it affects our near-term sales.
     We're going to make great products in future just like we have in the past, end of story.

Right.
     The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
     Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.

Hi.
     Thanks for taking my question.
>>> When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term?
     And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue?
     And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware.
     Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined.
     So, it's simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it.
     I think everyone on earth is going to want one.
