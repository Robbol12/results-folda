[TSLA_Q3_2022] From 2022 to 2024, how did Tesla’s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
>>> On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
     On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.

     Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
     Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.

     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.
     Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
     Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
     As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
     We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
