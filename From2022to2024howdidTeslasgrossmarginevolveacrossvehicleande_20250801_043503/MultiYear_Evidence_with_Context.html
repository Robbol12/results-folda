    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.</span>
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
    We love his optimism for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their 
own conclusions on progress being made?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?</span>
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
    The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
    So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware 
of and believe will happen over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Raw material exposure?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to add to what Elon is saying, there’s different ways to calculate raw material exposure.
    I think the simple way, we estimate we’re around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials.
    And just to clarify a couple of things on that.
    So, we’ve been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a number of quarters now.
    That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter.
    And what we’re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to add to what Elon is saying, there’s different ways to calculate raw material exposure.
    I think the simple way, we estimate we’re around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials.

    That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter.
    And what we’re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.
    And as indices move, it doesn’t impact us immediately or directly.
    In some cases, we have contracts with suppliers.
    But then as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can be a lag.
    In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or raw material prices.
    But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as well based on the contract.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.

<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    The Fremont team is doing a tremendous job.
    Really absolutely from the back  quarters.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

It’s hard to underweight.
    Like you should -- the expedite situation with the crazy logistics that occurred with COVID.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And to Elon’s point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable 
nature of our part arrivals, and our supply chain team, in particular, production planning portion of supply chain.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We often get very little notice when there’s part shortage is coming, and it’s kind of a scramble couple of days </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here.</span>
    And so, the amount of Herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that 
is absolutely immense.
    Elon Musk

There’s a saying in the military, it’s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it 
comes to war.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about 
previously on raw materials, commodities.
    Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring 
those costs down.
    Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide 
portion of the market.

portion of the market.
    And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
    Prices are higher for all other automakers.
    We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price 
of the vehicles.
    And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it’s one of the points.</span>
    But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the 
progression of prices over time?
    Elon Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.
    It’s been very difficult with the -- I mean, I think, inflation is at like a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>-year high.
    And I think the official numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation, so.
    And that inflation appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year is what -- when we’re 
talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severe cost pressure.
    So, yes, and in some cases, we’re seeing suppliers request <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% cost increases for parts from last year to the
end of this year.
    So, it’s -- there’s a lot of cost pressure there.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re 
going to be waiting forever.
    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are </span>

    Martin Viecha

All right.
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
    What do you expect run rates of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.

    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.

years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
    Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car
business, worth more than FSD.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; That’s my firm belief.</span>
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.

    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of 
expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    We’re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those
areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all 
the commodity costs.
    So, that’s an exception I needed to call out.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Similar to Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">discussed is achieved.</span>
    Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> and structural battery ramps.
    And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and 
higher-range structural pack provisions.
    Elon Musk

I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> and structural pack will be competitive with 
the best alternatives later this year.
    And we think we’ll exceed the best alternatives next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean we have some good existing proofs, right?
    Like we’ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    That’s my firm belief.
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.

    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
    We love his optimism for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their 
own conclusions on progress being made?
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.

    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    In some cases, our contracts do directly reflect movement in commodity prices or raw material prices.
    But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as well based on the contract.
    And so, to Elon’s point, what we’re trying to do here, because it’s quite an unprecedented situation of raw material
movement and all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts, is we’re trying to anticipate 
where things will go and make sure the pricing that we have put in place at the time that those raw material cost 
increases hit us that they align and that the company can remain financially healthy in various scenarios as we look out
over the next four quarters.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, why does Tesla continue to fight dealership laws on a state-by-state basis versus taking it 
federal?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Separately, why isn’t Tesla using </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">800</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">-volt architecture in its vehicles?</span>
    What are the advantages or disadvantages?
    Elon Musk

So, from Tesla’s standpoint, obviously, we’d like to have federal legislation that allows direct sales in all states, 
but we have not seen willingness on the part of the Congress to enact such law that would override a variety of state 
laws.
    So unfortunately, we have to fight it on a state-by-state basis.

    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you expect run rates of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
    But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> sometime perhaps towards the end of
the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter.
    Is that accurate?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about 
previously on raw materials, commodities.
    Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring 
those costs down.
    Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide 
portion of the market.
    And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
    Prices are higher for all other automakers.
    We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price 
of the vehicles.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.</span>
    So, it’s one of the points.
    But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the 
progression of prices over time?
    Elon Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.
    It’s been very difficult with the -- I mean, I think, inflation is at like a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>-year high.
    And I think the official numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation, so.
    And that inflation appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year is what -- when we’re 
talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severe cost pressure.
    So, yes, and in some cases, we’re seeing suppliers request <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% cost increases for parts from last year to the

    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and bottom line profitability.</span>
    GAAP automotive gross margin reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">32.9</span>% and first time exceeded <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% when excluding regulatory credits.
    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.</span>
    We love his optimism for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their 
own conclusions on progress being made?
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">22</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">38</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.</span>
    Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
    We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">23</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We put the seats on the battery and then we put that in the cars.
    So there’s actually <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>.
    So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re 
going to be waiting forever.
    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.</span>
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
    What do you expect run rates of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.

    Andrew Baglino

It’s hard to underweight.
    Like you should -- the expedite situation with the crazy logistics that occurred with COVID.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And to Elon’s point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable 
nature of our part arrivals, and our supply chain team, in particular, production planning portion of supply chain.
    We often get very little notice when there’s part shortage is coming, and it’s kind of a scramble couple of days 
before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here.
    And so, the amount of Herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that 
is absolutely immense.
    Elon Musk

There’s a saying in the military, it’s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it 
comes to war.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Yes.</span>
    So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about 
previously on raw materials, commodities.
    Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring 
those costs down.
    Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide 
portion of the market.
    And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
    Prices are higher for all other automakers.
    We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price 
of the vehicles.
    And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">25</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">111</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.</span>
    And then, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>
to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?

    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
    So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware 
of and believe will happen over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.
    Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Yes.</span>
    Just to add to what Elon is saying, there’s different ways to calculate raw material exposure.
    I think the simple way, we estimate we’re around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our cost structure exposed to raw materials.
    And just to clarify a couple of things on that.
    So, we’ve been experiencing increases in cost in general, but also raw materials for a number of quarters now.
    That pace picked up in Q1, so last quarter.
    And what we’re seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.
    And as indices move, it doesn’t impact us immediately or directly.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">28</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
    So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
    And then, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>
to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months from start of production.

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?</span>
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
    So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware 
of and believe will happen over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
    We love his optimism for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their 
own conclusions on progress being made?
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">self-driving.</span>
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
    The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
