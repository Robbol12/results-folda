Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features as we transition technologies.</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.

    Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
    As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence 
and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
    This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as
new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our 
R&amp;D spend.
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.</span>
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
    However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.

    I’m not recommending you to Tesla, but yes, buy low, sell high.
    Warren Buffett actually, I think has a saying -- I’m paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine
living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices 
at you, and it’s a different price every day.
    But the house is still the same house.
    So, this is a stock market.
    Credit that to Warren Buffett.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Where’s that crystal ball, again?
    If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the 
long-term picture.
    Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.
    I’d recommend looking at ARK Invest.
    I think their analysis is very good.
    It’s the best.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">314</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.
    So, there will be a like a Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.
    So, yes, that&#x27;s -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
    And then maybe a question for Zach.
    Back on the automotive gross margins.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% automotive </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.</span>
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
    Is it just the macro deteriorating?
    Is it the competitive landscape?
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
    And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.
    So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of 
the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.
    So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>, which only means that you’re -- 
it’s being used for maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> hours a week out of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">168</span>, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes
less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> of the hours of the week is doing something useful.
    You’ve increased the value of that by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a 
hardware company with software margins.
    Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
    Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.
    It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cost?</span>
    How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?
    And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
    So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.
    So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
    So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
    It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.

    I&#x27;m not looking for additional economics.
    I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology.
    And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% was that&#x27;s not so much that I can control the 
company, even if I go bonkers and if I&#x27;m, like, mad, they can throw me out.
    But it&#x27;s enough that I have a strong influence.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?</span>
    Vaibhav Taneja

Like, I said in my opening remarks, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles.
    This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the 
packaging used to get the materials to the production flow.
    Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further.
    A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which 
I mentioned leads to cost reduction.
    This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible.
    We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.
    However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

    And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping 
up pretty well, right?
    And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.
    In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other 
established factory, which is Fremont.

    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.
    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.</span>
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
    On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.

    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.

Understood.
    And then maybe a question for Zach.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Back on the automotive gross margins.</span>
    So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive 
gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
    Is it just the macro deteriorating?
    Is it the competitive landscape?
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
    And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?

    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate

    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
    And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> program as we steadily

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.

    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.
    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.</span>
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.

    You got to take care of the car.
    It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.
    So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of 
the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.
    So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>, which only means that you’re -- 
it’s being used for maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> hours a week out of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">168</span>, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes

    Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle

    And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
    So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.

see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts?
    And if so, when?

and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
    I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.

Thank you.
    The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let&#x27;s go to the battery question.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sorry.
    Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin.
    While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business 
will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We generally look to mid-</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% gross margins for any program that we launch.</span>
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>

reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not

    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new

proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.

    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
    This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as
new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our 
R&amp;D spend.
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, </span>

    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
    However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.
    Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.
    Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.

    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>

reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">business.</span>
    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">37</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.

    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> years of

    Thanks Martin.
    As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our 
energy and services and other businesses.
    Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
    As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence 
and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
    This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as
new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our 
R&amp;D spend.
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.</span>
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">23</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1671</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.</span>
    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicles in North America.
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle 
controls.
    We replaced <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">330</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> lines of C++ code with neural nets.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">24</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">70</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.</span>
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.

    Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?</span>
    And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.
    That&#x27;s our best product ever.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
    And just a brief update from the business perspective.
    Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;24 and &#x27;</span><span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>.
    We want to thank all of our partners who&#x27;ve put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical 
infrastructure around the world.
    And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> execution.
    Lathrop continues to ramp through <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>

    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
    On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase.

    We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a
Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles.
    The key among them being total cost of ownership.
    This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.
    We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support 
the overall demand.
    There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market.
    First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y,
which means an immediate reduction of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> at the time of purchase to the end customer.
    Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">28</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">91</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">29</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, steady improvements.
    And we&#x27;re very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.</span>
    The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then 
we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
    In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite 
of a very high interest rate environment.
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> and years to come.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">30</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">110</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    But as this business grows and smooths out, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re that far away from it.
    I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we&#x27;ll start doing
and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
    I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let&#x27;s go to the battery question.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sorry.
    Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.</span>
    We generally look to mid-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% gross margins for any program that we launch.
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.
    Elon Musk

We&#x27;re hopeful to get there later this year, but that&#x27;s not a promise.
    That&#x27;s an aspiration.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how well are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
    How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?
