[TSLA_Q1_2023] From 2022 to 2024, how did Teslaâ€™s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #57]  First, automotive ****gross** **margin**** and operating **margin** reduced sequentially.
2. [Sentence #59]  In particular, automotive ****gross** **margin**** was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve **vehicle** pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.
3. [Sentence #70]  Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our **vehicle** and **energy** businesses.
4. [Sentence #90]  The second question is, do you still believe Tesla **Energy** will be bigger than auto?
5. [Sentence #91]  And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla **Energy**?
6. [Sentence #110]  While we're not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the **vehicle** business.
7. [Sentence #111]  We generally look to mid-20% **gross** margins for any program that we launch.
8. [Sentence #143]  The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive **gross** margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?
9. [Sentence #313]  Back on the automotive **gross** margins.
10. [Sentence #314]  So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20% automotive ****gross** **margin**** was still probably a reasonable floor.
