[TSLA_Q1_2023] From 2022 to 2024, how did Teslaâ€™s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

1. [Sentence #59] [PILOT]
     And Zach has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
     I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
     And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
     There's three main points I want to make.
     First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
     But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
>>> In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.
     Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
     Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
     However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes.
     Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries.
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.

     And yes, super appreciated.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

3. [Sentence #314] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, we internally call it robotaxi.
     But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will achieve full autonomy.
     So, there will be a like a Model 3 or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.
     So, yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
     And then maybe a question for Zach.
     Back on the automotive gross margins.
>>> So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20% automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.
     Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
     Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
     Is it just the macro deteriorating?
     Is it the competitive landscape?
     Anything else that's sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
     And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

4. [Sentence #313] [UNCERTAIN]
     This is just not the time to talk about it in details product.
     So, we internally call it robotaxi.
     But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will achieve full autonomy.
     So, there will be a like a Model 3 or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.

5. [Sentence #143] [PLAN]
     We'll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
     And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
     We made significant improvements in both areas.
     Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased 12% and [Indiscernible] peak rate increased by 20% and through yields improved by 20%.
     Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months.
     And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
     This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
     There's a lot of macro uncertainty.
     There's also headwinds and tailwinds.
     And this is basically a question I think that's asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
     And within costs, there's a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in the macro world.
     Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we're working on is around ramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
-----
6. [Sentence #111] [PLAN]
     I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we'll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
     I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let's go to the battery question.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sorry.
     Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin.
     While we're not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the vehicle business.
>>> We generally look to mid-20% gross margins for any program that we launch.
     And so we're not there yet on this business, but that's what we're working towards.
     Elon Musk

We're hopeful to get there later this year, but that's not a promise.
     That's an aspiration.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
     How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?
     Drew?

7. [Sentence #70] [PLAN]
     Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries.
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.
     This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
     We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
     Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year.
>>> Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
     We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
     And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
     To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And let's go to investor questions on say.com.
     The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
-----
8. [Sentence #90] [PLAN]
     Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
     It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
     But it's -- and unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that's right.
     I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
     But it is something that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
     And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
     Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
     So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage.
     If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
     So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
     So that is in line with expectations.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
-----
10. [Sentence #110] [PLAN]
     But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it.
     I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we'll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
     I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
