Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features as we transition technologies.</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% automotive </span>

    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate

ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.

    I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we&#x27;ll start doing
and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
    I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let&#x27;s go to the battery question.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sorry.
    Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin.
    While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business 
will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We generally look to mid-</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% gross margins for any program that we launch.</span>
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.
    Elon Musk

We&#x27;re hopeful to get there later this year, but that&#x27;s not a promise.
    That&#x27;s an aspiration.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how well are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
    How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?

    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.</span>
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.

    Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.

    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?</span>
    And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.</span>
    We generally look to mid-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% gross margins for any program that we launch.
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.

We&#x27;re hopeful to get there later this year, but that&#x27;s not a promise.
    That&#x27;s an aspiration.

Thank you.
    The next question is, how well are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
    How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?
