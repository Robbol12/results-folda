Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the Company.
    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and bottom line profitability.</span>
    GAAP automotive gross margin reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">32.9</span>% and first time exceeded <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% when excluding regulatory credits.
    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.</span>
    Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
    We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.

    My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number
of other executives.
    Our Q1 results were announced at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this 
webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.</span>
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
