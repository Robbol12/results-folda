their stated margin targets?

    And part of the work we&#x27;re doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as 
Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla&#x27;s plans anyways.
    And so I think we&#x27;re pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
    But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers.
    And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in 
our products going forward.
    And so as we&#x27;re thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were 
looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not 
only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> per car
of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps.
    So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.

    And so two other comments I want to make on this.
    Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
    As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we&#x27;re delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been
so long for so much of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
    The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we&#x27;re most focused on what our operating
margin is.
    And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing 
faster than the vehicle business and as we&#x27;re heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our 
overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial 
progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the 
quarter.
    Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
    The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through
their initial ramps.
    Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
    I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
    You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">27.9</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and 
factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
    Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, 
which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
    While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign 
exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and 
logistics.
    The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit 
economics.
    Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to 
some extent in the second half of the year.
    We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these 
challenges.
    Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related startup costs have wound down as these factories have moved 
into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS.

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">17.2</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% with automotive gross margin at </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">27.9</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.

    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">27.9</span>%.

    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

primarily managing to now.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don&#x27;t is 
that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled
and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
    So that&#x27;s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a 
small percentage of cars don&#x27;t have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that means that there&#x27;s millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% gross margin.</span>
    And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
    And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
    That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
    Yeah.

    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and bottom line profitability.</span>
    GAAP automotive gross margin reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">32.9</span>% and first time exceeded <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% when excluding regulatory credits.
    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the Company.
    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
    Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin 
and bottom line profitability.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; GAAP automotive gross margin reached </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">32.9</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% and first time exceeded </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">30</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% when excluding regulatory credits.</span>

    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">38</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.</span>
    Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
    We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And so I think we&#x27;re pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
    But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers.
    And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in 
our products going forward.
    And so as we&#x27;re thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were 
looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not 
only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> per car
of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps.
    So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analyst released expectations that Tesla automotive 
gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% and average selling price around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">47</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> across all 
models.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I&#x27;ll jump in on this.
    So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I&#x27;ll share what&#x27;s in our current 
forecast for a moment.
    So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we&#x27;ll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the 
question, so <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and rent credits and then $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">47</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ASP across all models.
    And so two other comments I want to make on this.
    Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.

    My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number

    Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those

    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.</span>
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.

    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> -- just going through the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> recap.
    It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
    It was our best year ever on every level.
    Team did an amazing job.
    It&#x27;s an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, we delivered over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1.3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million cars and achieved a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% operating margin, the highest among any volume </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.</span>
    While doing so, we generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> billion in net income and $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7.5</span> billion in free cash flow.
    Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was an incredibly challenging year 
due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1773</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">16</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2099</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And so we would guess, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.
    We are -- the Telsa China team is winning in China.
    And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China.
    So, hopefully, that continues.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re fired about the future and well, it&#x27;s going to be great.
    George Gianarikas

Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles.
    You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">accelerate EV adoption?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I&#x27;m not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try.
    Yes, of course, of course.
    So, we actually look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles because if the -- for the longest time, 
we&#x27;ve been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output.
    And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market?
    Well, it doesn&#x27;t really help if all you&#x27;re doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another.
    In fact, it hurts because you add complexity, but you don&#x27;t add incremental volume.
    So, it&#x27;s sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability
of lithium-ion batteries.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, it’s – manage price, frankly.
    But we have so much excess demand.
    That is really just not an issue for us.
    It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.
    Toni Sacconaghi

Okay.
    Thank you.
    Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years from near life or death to a company with consistent </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cash flow and industry-leading margins.</span>
    I am wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of
your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> years or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> years.
    I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn’t be on calls unless there is something unusual and you have been on 
every call since then.
    I am wondering how<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

I do a lot of unusual things, let’s face it.
    Basically, if there is only good news, I won’t be on the call.
    But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call – 
relatively speaking, if there is bad news.
    And we have this good news, then I won’t be on the call.
    But I am committed to the long – I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of 
sustainability and autonomy.

Thank you.
    The next question is you made the right economic call before most on inflation when you diversified into Bitcoin.
    It has since shown it’s not much of a hedge in the real world test in the last few months.
    How do you think about it as an asset over long-term and what do you need to see to change your view?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, Tesla is – Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.</span>
    We are not really – cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow.
    So, it’s – we are not a – cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot.
    We think a lot about scaling production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat 
waves around earth, so to emphasize the urgency of that transition.
    So that is what we are trying to do is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage battery packs.
    But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future, which is like solar and wind for energy generation, stationary
battery packs for storage of the solar energy because of its intermittency and then electric vehicles, the third pillar.
    And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization.
    And the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we’re doing this, so certainly, my primary motivation here is to 
have the day of sustainable energy comes sooner.

    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">27.9</span>%.
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.</span>
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
    Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound 
logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
    Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the 
final two weeks.
    As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound 
logistics.
    We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">700</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> per long-range Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">45</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?</span>
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
