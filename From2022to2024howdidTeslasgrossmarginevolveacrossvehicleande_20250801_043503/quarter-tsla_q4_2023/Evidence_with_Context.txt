[TSLA_Q4_2023] From 2022 to 2024, how did Teslaâ€™s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

1. [Sentence #186] [PLAN]
     I'm not looking for additional economics.
     I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology.
     And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that's not so much that I can control the company, even if I go bonkers and if I'm, like, mad, they can throw me out.
     But it's enough that I have a strong influence.
     That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence, but not control.
     If there's some way to achieve that that would be great.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?
     Vaibhav Taneja

Like, I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles.
     This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production flow.
     Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further.
     A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which I mentioned leads to cost reduction.
     This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible.
     We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.
     However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of...

We don't know.

     Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
     I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
     In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand.
     Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
     This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recently gone through a similar change in their account.
     Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&P 500.
     In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck ramp.
>>> As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
     That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
     While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
     On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023.
     We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase.
     Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before.
     We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles.
     The key among them being total cost of ownership.

     This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.

     And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.
     This brings us to 2024.
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
     Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
>>> We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
     For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions.
     This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
     So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
     This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
     That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.
     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.

     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It's like finally, the future.
     Looks like the future.
     It's just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the Cybertruck.
     That's our best product ever.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you.
>>> The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
     And just a brief update from the business perspective.
     Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through '24 and '25.
     We want to thank all of our partners who've put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical infrastructure around the world.
     And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong 2023 execution.
     Lathrop continues to ramp through 2024 with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from 20 gigawatt to 40 gigawatt hours by the end of the year.

     We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand.
     There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market.
     First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer.
     Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.

     So, steady improvements.
     And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
     This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
     So there'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
     But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
     So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
     This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
>>> Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
     The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world.
     Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
     In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment.
     And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing.
     But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
     I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
     And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come.
