    Vaibhav Taneja

Like, I said in my opening remarks, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles.
    This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the 
packaging used to get the materials to the production flow.
    Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further.
    A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which 
I mentioned leads to cost reduction.
    This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible.
    We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.
    However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.

    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior

    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.

    Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.

    So, steady improvements.
    And we&#x27;re very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.</span>
    The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then 
we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
    In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite 
of a very high interest rate environment.
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> and years to come.
