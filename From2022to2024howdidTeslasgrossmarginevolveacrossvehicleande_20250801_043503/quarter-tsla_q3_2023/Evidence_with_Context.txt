[TSLA_Q3_2023] From 2022 to 2024, how did Tesla’s gross margin evolve across vehicle and energy segments, and did it match their stated margin targets?

1. [Sentence #261] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.
     So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.
     So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of 5, which only means that you’re -- it’s being used for maybe 50 hours a week out of 168, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes less than 1/3 of the hours of the week is doing something useful.
     You’ve increased the value of that by 5, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a hardware company with software margins.
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
     Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.
     It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.
>>> Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle cost?
     How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?
     And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
     So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.
     So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
     So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
     It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.

     It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.
     And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right?
     And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.
     In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other established factory, which is Fremont.

3. [Sentence #260] [UNCERTAIN]
     You got to take care of the car.
     It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.
     So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.

4. [Sentence #15] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
>>> And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.

5. [Sentence #44] [PILOT]
     The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.
     I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
     And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
     Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
     And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
>>> Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business.
     Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
     As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades.
     This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
     Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500.
     We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
     Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
     On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
