    Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.
    It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle </span>

    How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?
    And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
    So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.
    So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
    So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
    It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.

    And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping 
up pretty well, right?
    And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.
    In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other 
established factory, which is Fremont.

    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.</span>
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.

    The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it 
comes to real world AI.
    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.

    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">37</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
