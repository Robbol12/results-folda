Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s First Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast.
2. [Sentence #14]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, **gross** margins, operating **margin** and bottom line profitability.
3. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) GAAP automotive ****gross** **margin**** reached 32.9% and first time exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits.
4. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And as this business grows, the **energy** division is becoming our highest **margin** business.
5. [Sentence #38]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our **gross** margins in Q2.
6. [Sentence #57]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) First, automotive ****gross** **margin**** and operating **margin** reduced sequentially.
7. [Sentence #59]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) In particular, automotive ****gross** **margin**** was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve **vehicle** pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.
8. [Sentence #77]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) On GAAP automotive ****gross** **margin****, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
9. [Sentence #84]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating **margin** was 17.2% with automotive ****gross** **margin**** at 27.9%.
10. [Sentence #85]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) As a result, our auto ****gross** **margin**** improved sequentially.
11. [Sentence #86]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) That said, predicting auto **gross** margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
12. [Sentence #87]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto ****gross** **margin**** would have been nearly 30%.
13. [Sentence #88]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) If we look specifically at our automotive business, our ****gross** **margin**** showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve **vehicle** affordability early in the quarter.
14. [Sentence #90]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) For our **energy** business, we improved margins and **gross** profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack.
15. [Sentence #111]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We generally look to mid-20% **gross** margins for any program that we launch.
16. [Sentence #117]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla **Energy** products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
17. [Sentence #125]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analyst released expectations that Tesla automotive ****gross** **margin****, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models.
18. [Sentence #126]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Where do you see average selling price and **gross** margins after the price cuts?
19. [Sentence #130]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are **stated** in the question, so 20% automotive ****gross** **margin****, excluding leases and rent credits and then $47,000 ASP across all models.
20. [Sentence #137]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the **energy** business, which is growing faster than the **vehicle** business and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating **margin**.
21. [Sentence #142]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% ****gross** **margin****.
22. [Sentence #143]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive **gross** margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?
23. [Sentence #186]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive ****gross** **margin**** ex-regulatory credits for the full year?
24. [Sentence #260]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) It’s about like your ****gross** **margin**** in the quarter.
25. [Sentence #261]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Could you give us a sense of like in how the ****gross** **margin**** evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle cost?
26. [Sentence #264]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that ****gross** **margin**** going forward.
27. [Sentence #303]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive ****gross** **margin****, can investors expect to see automotive ****gross** **margin**** stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts?
28. [Sentence #306]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) If I may, look, the short-term variances in ****gross** **margin**** and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.
29. [Sentence #313]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Back on the automotive **gross** margins.
30. [Sentence #314]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20% automotive ****gross** **margin**** was still probably a reasonable floor.
