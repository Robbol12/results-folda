[TSLA_Q2_2022] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2019 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

     Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO [ph], and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
     But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
     And so that’s why I am confident we will get to 5,000 cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin, go ahead please.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
>>> Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
     I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it.
     Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
     The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
     It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
     Colin Rusch

Great.

2. [Sentence #27] [PILOT]
     And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000 vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next few months.
     To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the 2170 cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call.
     But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year.
     So we are not dependent on 4680.
     4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
     That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas.
     And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
>>> Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.
     They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.
     We have now driven over 35 million miles with FSD beta.
     That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than any – all other companies combined.
     So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
     With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage.
     We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
     And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.

Great.
     And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
     But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues with as you move into production?

     Super appreciate it.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter.
>>> Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.
     Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
     The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps.
     Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
     I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
     You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
     On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
