    It&#x27;s going to happen.
    And you can&#x27;t stop the advent of electric cars.
    It&#x27;s going to happen.
    The other thing holding back electric cars was range and that is a solved problem.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Great.
    And then as a follow-up, in the past, Elon, you had made a comment that you&#x27;d be willing to sell cars at effectively
no margin to get the cars out there.
    And there&#x27;s a comment in the release today of the rate of acceleration of the autonomy efforts does impact volume 
growth.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more </span>
<span class="r5">vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, I&#x27;m not sure I understand the question.
    We have a lot of cars.
    I mean, you&#x27;ve got millions of cars out there.
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
    More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements 
on FSD?

Well, right now, the constraint we&#x27;re trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
    And now Q1, we&#x27;ve got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.
    That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
    But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we&#x27;re talking that the executive team and I were talking about just 
before this call was we&#x27;ve got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one 
way or another.

Great.
    All right.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro 
environment.
    We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
    For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who 
helped us achieve this.
    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the </span>
<span class="r5">recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.</span>
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span class="r2">35</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
    All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span class="r2">2025</span>.
