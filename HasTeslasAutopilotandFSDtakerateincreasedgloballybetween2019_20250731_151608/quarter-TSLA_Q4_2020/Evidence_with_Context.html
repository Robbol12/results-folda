    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.
    As Zach mentioned, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we&#x27;re making 
great progress in that regard.
    And I think we&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s really dialed in this year.

Thank you.
    The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
    This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increased sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on used 
vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Unfortunately, we&#x27;re not considering that at this time.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We do actually offer an increased – higher price than for a car with FSD than one without FSD.</span>
    And I do think that the market currently undervalues – or the consumer market.
    And arguably the stock market sales probably undervalue the just how good FSD is going to be.
    But we&#x27;re not currently planning on offering – on allowing it to get transferred.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Elon Musk

We will be offering subscription pretty soon in the next month or two.
    So that should address a lot of people&#x27;s concerns for being able to get it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

    And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar
and Tesla Roof.
    And we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, 
whether it&#x27;s retrofit or but  roof before the end of the year.
    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.

    Elon Musk

Yes, to be clear, we are still not -- the software still does not fully use the capabilities of the FSD in <span class="r2">1</span> computer.
    It is really just incredibly powerful computer and I am personally certain that you can create full self-driving 
with safe level <span class="r2">5</span> presence just using the Full Self-Driving version <span class="r2">1</span> computer.
    The version <span class="r2">2</span>, we expect to be about 3x as powerful.
    And this needs to be paired with higher resolution cameras.
    And so it&#x27;s quite a -- it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously.
    But we have not been rushing the version <span class="r2">2</span> of the chip.
    It&#x27;s coming along well, and it&#x27;s in good shape.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But since we can achieve FSD, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right </span>
<span class="r4">now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving, the Tesla FSD chip </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> because it would set us back quite a bit on </span>
<span class="r4">software.</span>
    And software is the critical path to Full Self-Driving.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about that.
    That&#x27;s not a -- that&#x27;s an improvement but not a game changer.
    That has to be changed.
    Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to be video, that&#x27;s the game changer.

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">264</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[PILOT]</span>
    So I really do see this as a question of getting work done.
    We&#x27;re getting it done.
    And you can see the results in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are at least -- we&#x27;re also going to be expanding
the FSD beta itself to include more and more people.
    So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive <span class="r2">100</span>% safer than
a person.
    Yes.
    I really don&#x27;t see any obstacles here.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license any of its software </span>
<span class="r4">applications, FSD and auto bidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?</span>
    Elon Musk

I think we&#x27;re very open to licensing our software to third parties.
    And we&#x27;ve had some preliminary discussions about licensing autopilot to other OEMs.
    So this is something we&#x27;re more than happy to do.
    And -- but I think, obviously, like we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla Autopilot is 
capable of full self-driving, which is, I think, will become obvious later this year.
    And then we&#x27;re more than happy to license that to other car companies.
    We&#x27;re definitely not trying to keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation.
    And I think the probably same goes for Autobidder.

    We haven&#x27;t thought as much about Autobidder, but the Tesla philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens.
    We&#x27;re going to allow other companies to use our supercharge networks.
    And yes, using our autonomy software and Autobidder be fine to.

<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">286</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So I think we&#x27;re mostly doing something right if we&#x27;re the best-selling electric car in China.
    That said, very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as <span class="r2">1</span>% or <span class="r2">2</span>%, actually have selected the FSD 
option.
    This is much lower than rest of world.
    So we definitely need to make it work well in China.
    I think some of it works well in China, then we will have a Grade <span class="r2">4</span> FSD.
    I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
    Their attention to detail is incredible.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So they -- I&#x27;m confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.</span>
    And we hopefully that is later this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">76</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And I think there is a way, just with back of the envelop math, to potentially justify it, where -- if Tesla&#x27;s 
ships, let&#x27;s say, hypothetically, $<span class="r2">50</span> billion or $<span class="r2">60</span> billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become Full 
Self-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of <span class="r2">12</span> hours a week
to potentially an average of <span class="r2">60</span> hours a week, if they&#x27;re capable of serving as robotaxi.
    So that&#x27;s like roughly a 5x increase in utility.
    But let&#x27;s -- even if you say like, okay, let&#x27;s just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not 5x as 
useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost 
entirely gross margin.
    So it would mean, it would be like if you made $<span class="r2">50</span> million -- $<span class="r2">50</span> billion worth of cars, it will be like having $<span class="r2">50</span> 
billion of incremental profit basically from that because it&#x27;s just software.
    So --  on that, it&#x27;s like $<span class="r2">1</span> trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode.
    So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and 
nothing else, the cars with FSD.
    And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So in conclusion, while </span><span class="r4">2020</span><span class="r4"> was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just </span>
<span class="r4">the beginning.</span>
    We think <span class="r2">2021</span> is going to be even more exciting.
    And you don&#x27;t know what to expect in a given year.
    Obviously, last year, we did not <span class="r2">0</span> many things we do not expect.
    But assuming that <span class="r7">&#x27;21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint I think it&#x27;</span>s going to be a great year 
for Tesla.
    We&#x27;ve got a ton of -- many great new products coming out.
    We&#x27;ve got factories that are -- advanced factories  set up production.
    It will also make it easier having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint.

    And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrode?
    At the Battery Day, Elon said, <span class="r7">&#x27;I would not say this is completely in the bag as – yet as the yields were low.&#x27;</span>
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">60</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    But it&#x27;s really better in many ways.
    We will be actually raising the price of Model S for these new models, so people -- because the old model -- the new
model will be $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> more.
    So, hopefully, people aren&#x27;t too upset if they bought the old model last month, but this one is 10k more.
    Yes, we think it’s probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve made massive progress on Full Self-Driving.
    I recommend watching the videos of our public beta.
    So we&#x27;ve got, I think, almost <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> people in the beta at this point.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And with each successful release of the beta – of the FSD software, just -- it&#x27;s really improving rapidly.</span>
    It&#x27;s not very common for -- I drive the .
    It&#x27;s very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place that I&#x27;ve never 
been to.
    So these are not preplanned routes.
    There are -- the car has never been there before.
    And it&#x27;s now actually more -- it&#x27;s more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on a complex 
drive.
    So -- and this is -- basically, I&#x27;m highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability  of a human this 
year.
    This is a very big deal.
