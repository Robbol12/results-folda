[Year Q4] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2019 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #123]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

The **rate** card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with **Autopilot**.
2. [Sentence #139]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) The -- like the core autopilots in Tesla or **Autopilot** software and AI team is just is I think very, very strong in making great progress.
3. [Sentence #140]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And we're really only getting to **take** full advantage of the **Autopilot** hardware and the **FSD** hardware.
4. [Sentence #493]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And with each successful release of the beta – of the **FSD** software, just -- it's really improving rapidly.
5. [Sentence #509]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of **profitability**, we believe this is just the beginning.
6. [Sentence #575]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) This would be a huge for loyalty and overall **increased** sales of vehicles who are offering more **FSD** sales on used vehicles.
7. [Sentence #577]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We do actually offer an **increased** – higher price than for a car with **FSD** than one without **FSD**.
8. [Sentence #579]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And arguably the stock market sales probably undervalue the just how good **FSD** is going to be.
9. [Sentence #697]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license any of its software applications, **FSD** and auto bidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?
10. [Sentence #701]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And -- but I think, obviously, like we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove that Tesla **Autopilot** is capable of full self-driving, which is, I think, will become obvious later this year.
11. [Sentence #719]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So they -- I'm confident that they will buy **FSD** as soon as it’s working on time.
12. [Sentence #889]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) But since we can achieve **FSD**, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be a distraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving, the Tesla **FSD** chip 2 because it would set us back quite a bit on software.
13. [Sentence #1043]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) So, over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important source of **profitability** for Tesla.
14. [Sentence #1129]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And with the rapid development of **FSD**, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the profits generated by selling hardware.
15. [Sentence #1231]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) In markets that have Tesla insurance, what kind of uptake rates are you seeing?
16. [Sentence #1248]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Take** rates have been quite strong.
17. [Sentence #1306]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And I think as more and more people experience that, **take** rates there, and then as we work towards the robotaxi space, there's actually quite a bit of upside on margins from a software perspective.
18. [Sentence #1417]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I'm wondering if you could just share what your current attach **rate** might be for **FSD** on your vehicles or how to think about the progress of your attach **rate** or revenue in **FSD**, let's say, in '21 versus '20?
19. [Sentence #1425]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I mean, effectively long term, every car will have **FSD**.
20. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the ****take** **rate**** of **FSD** today?
21. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So do you already see that people are getting more excited by **FSD**, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the ****take** **rate****?
22. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Elon Musk

The trend is very strong towards use of **FSD**.
23. [Sentence #1887]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) There's enhanced **Autopilot**, the price of which is listed on the website.
24. [Sentence #2135]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth **rate** in 2024.
25. [Sentence #2799]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the recognition of **FSD**-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
26. [Sentence #3201]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on **FSD**, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to **take** advantage of your tech advances?
27. [Sentence #3205]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, **Autopilot** Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with **FSD**?
28. [Sentence #3208]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on **FSD**?
