profitability from FSD as predicted?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">205</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how has FSD take rate change since the 
introduction of monthly subscription?
    Are there any plans to increase the FSD pricing as why the release becomes imminent?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll take the second part of the question first, we won&#x27;t be providing any forward-looking commentary on our pricing 
strategy or what may happen here over the near term.
    With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to impact within the 
Company.
    What I&#x27;ll say, just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments, is that the things that we 
learned on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant.
    This is really more of a platform for when FSD Beta goes into wide release, and the features and functionality 
become more accessible to more customers.
    The second thing that I&#x27;ll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and 
then you compare that to the cost of rolling FSD option into your lease or you loan, on a monthly basis to note the 
economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and enrolling 
into their financing.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as a result of that, what we&#x27;ve seen in the data is not -- we&#x27;re unable to detect a change in the upfront take </span>
<span class="r4">rate of FSD when people when people purchase cars.</span>
    We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks carry us to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing 
to it and enjoying it to that route.
    But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we&#x27;ve seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.
    We&#x27;ll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.

Thank you very much.
    And now let&#x27;s go to analyst questions.

    The next question is, is Tesla considering any other ideas other than FSD with the real-world AI that can bring 
additional software revenue to Tesla?
    If not, can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD Beta?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    At AI Day we did talk about potential future where Dojo could be used as a neural net training platform for other 
companies.
    It&#x27;s not a focus of ours today as we are fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses, we do expect to continue 
to improve the in-car experience in the context of FSD

    I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here, you&#x27;ve been great to work with.
    We have a road map of additional states.
    We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals.
    And our goal is to be in every major market in which we have cars in.
    The -- we did a soft launch in Texas, was its last week?
    Pierre Ferragu

Uh-huh.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what we&#x27;re seeing in initial take rate data is that, if you compare that to what we&#x27;re seeing in California, </span>
<span class="r4">we&#x27;re off to a good start here.</span>
    So, we&#x27;re very excited about it.
    We&#x27;re excited about individual risk-based pricing.
    We&#x27;re excited about the ability for folks to become safer and as a result, save money.
    And it feeds into our priority of a Company of building the safest products in the world.
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    If I can add to that, it&#x27;s really exciting for the engineering team, for the finance team in taking on safety into 
their world to explore basis.
    Thanks for that, guys.

    And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.
    And so, we&#x27;ll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.
    So, it&#x27;s difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
    With respect to operating margin, we&#x27;ve been very focused as a Company on managing our overhead expenses and 
operating expenses.
    And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to happen.
    And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 
<span class="r2">4</span> of <span class="r2">5</span> quarters.
    As we think forward, the business up until this point is kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a 
little bit of software on top of that.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there&#x27;s considerable </span>
<span class="r4">upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix</span>
<span class="r4">of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.</span>
    So, we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, 
just a little bit difficult over the next <span class="r2">4</span> to <span class="r2">5</span> quarters.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.
    There&#x27;s just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you, Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
    Joseph Spak

Yes, the question is just -- you mentioned LSP acts globally for standard range models.
    My understanding is that all comes from China.
    Is that the continued go-forward plan or do you want to have LSP capabilities in other factories around the world?

    Can you click unmute?
    Okay.
    While the team is working on that, let&#x27;s just go back to say the questions.
    The next set of upcoming question is, Can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, 
something less than <span class="r2">10</span>-K?
    Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.
    You lose the value on the trade-in, and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD </span>
<span class="r4">compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.</span>
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

    Super charging team has done a great job rolling this out.
    But it requires a combination of the <span class="r2">250</span>-kilowatt charging in our latest iteration battery packs.
    Andrew Baglino

And we&#x27;ve also maintained an ongoing roadmap on software improvements, dynamic routing to avoid busy superchargers; 
that&#x27;s actually really helpful.
    We take the real-time busyness of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate people on their road 
trip.
    And beyond that, we&#x27;re also continuing to improve the Trip Planner itself and how it estimates how much energy 
people use so it&#x27;s not too conservative and ask them to be able to charge more than they need to, which is another thing
that can delay a total trip.
