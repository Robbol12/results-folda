    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll take the second part of the question first, we won&#x27;t be providing any forward-looking commentary on our pricing 
strategy or what may happen here over the near term.
    With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to impact within the 
Company.
    What I&#x27;ll say, just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments, is that the things that we 
learned on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant.
    This is really more of a platform for when FSD Beta goes into wide release, and the features and functionality 
become more accessible to more customers.
    The second thing that I&#x27;ll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and 
then you compare that to the cost of rolling FSD option into your lease or you loan, on a monthly basis to note the 
economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and enrolling 
into their financing.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as a result of that, what we&#x27;ve seen in the data is not -- we&#x27;re unable to detect a change in the upfront take </span>
<span class="r4">rate of FSD when people when people purchase cars.</span>
    We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks carry us to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing 
to it and enjoying it to that route.
    But again, as I said at the beginning, I think what we&#x27;ve seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.
    We&#x27;ll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.

    A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model <span class="r2">3</span>
or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.
    So, you don&#x27;t expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
    A Cybercab looks different.
    A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model <span class="r2">3</span> are -- look, they&#x27;re good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
    You don&#x27;t expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it 
does.
    So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we&#x27;re doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in 
the software, we&#x27;ll roll out another sort of <span class="r2">30</span>-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
    And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">/</span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> event.</span>
    Yes.
    So, there&#x27;s no need to wait for robotaxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy.
    We expect to achieve that next year with the -- with our existing vehicle line.

    The next question is, is Tesla considering any other ideas other than FSD with the real-world AI that can bring 
additional software revenue to Tesla?
    If not, can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD Beta?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    At AI Day we did talk about potential future where Dojo could be used as a neural net training platform for other 
companies.
    It&#x27;s not a focus of ours today as we are fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses, we do expect to continue 
to improve the in-car experience in the context of FSD

    I do want to thank the Texas insurance regulators here, you&#x27;ve been great to work with.
    We have a road map of additional states.
    We will launch the product in those states as we receive regulatory approvals.

    The -- we did a soft launch in Texas, was its last week?
    Pierre Ferragu

Uh-huh.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what we&#x27;re seeing in initial take rate data is that, if you compare that to what we&#x27;re seeing in California, </span>
<span class="r4">we&#x27;re off to a good start here.</span>
    So, we&#x27;re very excited about it.
    We&#x27;re excited about individual risk-based pricing.
    We&#x27;re excited about the ability for folks to become safer and as a result, save money.
    And it feeds into our priority of a Company of building the safest products in the world.
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    If I can add to that, it&#x27;s really exciting for the engineering team, for the finance team in taking on safety into

    Thanks for that, guys.

    And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.
    And so, we&#x27;ll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.
    So, it&#x27;s difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
    With respect to operating margin, we&#x27;ve been very focused as a Company on managing our overhead expenses and 
operating expenses.
    And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to happen.
    And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 
<span class="r2">4</span> of <span class="r2">5</span> quarters.
    As we think forward, the business up until this point is kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a 
little bit of software on top of that.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there&#x27;s considerable </span>
<span class="r4">upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix</span>
<span class="r4">of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.</span>
    So, we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, 
just a little bit difficult over the next <span class="r2">4</span> to <span class="r2">5</span> quarters.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.
    There&#x27;s just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.

Thank you, Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
    Joseph Spak

Yes, the question is just -- you mentioned LSP acts globally for standard range models.
    My understanding is that all comes from China.
    Is that the continued go-forward plan or do you want to have LSP capabilities in other factories around the world?

<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over </span><span class="r4">0.5</span><span class="r4"> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving </span>
<span class="r4">beta, and that number is growing rapidly.</span>
    We recently completed a <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> GPU cluster of H100s.
    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span class="r2">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

    Okay.
    While the team is working on that, let&#x27;s just go back to say the questions.
    The next set of upcoming question is, Can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, 
something less than <span class="r2">10</span>-K?
    Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.
    You lose the value on the trade-in, and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD </span>
<span class="r4">compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.</span>
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

    Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.
    So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.
    But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to 
necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where 
the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
    And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.
    And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a 
very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level.
    So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available 
and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD </span>
<span class="r4">over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly 
astounding in a positive way.
    When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about <span class="r2">10</span> to <span class="r2">12</span> hours of usage per week.
    That’s -- if you drive <span class="r2">1.5</span>-hour a day on average, that’s roughly <span class="r2">10</span> hours a week out of <span class="r2">168</span> hours.
    And then there’s also you’re going to have parking and insurance.
    You got to take care of the car.
    It’s like there’s a lot of overhead.

And we&#x27;ve also maintained an ongoing roadmap on software improvements, dynamic routing to avoid busy superchargers; 
that&#x27;s actually really helpful.
    We take the real-time busyness of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate people on their road

    And beyond that, we&#x27;re also continuing to improve the Trip Planner itself and how it estimates how much energy 
people use so it&#x27;s not too conservative and ask them to be able to charge more than they need to, which is another thing
that can delay a total trip.

    And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.
    And we&#x27;re also -- so that&#x27;s <span class="r2">12.5</span>.
    Version <span class="r2">13</span> of FSD is going out soon.
    will elaborate more on that later in the call.
    We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to <span class="r2">12.5</span>.
    And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three 
orders of magnitude.
    So, that&#x27;s a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than </span>
<span class="r4">human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it&#x27;s next -- it </span>
<span class="r4">seems extremely likely to be next year.</span>
    Ashok, do you want to say anything?
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
    Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 10<span class="r2">0x</span> improvement with <span class="r2">12.5</span> from 
starting of this year and then with v13 release.
    We expect to be <span class="r2">1</span>,00<span class="r2">0x</span> from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
    And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also 
helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

software update, you can’t change that.
    It has to be hard-coded.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.</span>
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span class="r2">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
    Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.

aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r2">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r4">a </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll take the second part of the question first, we won&#x27;t be providing any forward-looking commentary on our pricing 
strategy or what may happen here over the near term.
    With respect to the first part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to impact within the 
Company.
    What I&#x27;ll say, just as a general statement before I make a couple of specific comments, is that the things that we 
learned on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant.
    This is really more of a platform for when FSD Beta goes into wide release, and the features and functionality 
become more accessible to more customers.
    The second thing that I&#x27;ll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSD subscription, and 
then you compare that to the cost of rolling FSD option into your lease or you loan, on a monthly basis to note the 
economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of full self-driving is through purchasing it upfront and enrolling 
into their financing.
    And as a result of that, what we&#x27;ve seen in the data is not -- we&#x27;re unable to detect a change in the upfront take

    We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks carry us to experience what the software has to offer and subscribing 
to it and enjoying it to that route.

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
    Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span class="r2">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some 
certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
    It must have a lead car in plains, only <span class="r2">40</span> miles per hour.
    Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
    But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.

    And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots.
    Now obviously, we need to make sure that it’s a good place for humans in that future.
    We do not create some variance of the terminator outcome.
    So, we’re going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot.
    So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can’t change that, even if you put -- like a 
software update, you can’t change that.
    It has to be hard-coded.

    But it requires a combination of the <span class="r2">250</span>-kilowatt charging in our latest iteration battery packs.
    Andrew Baglino

And we&#x27;ve also maintained an ongoing roadmap on software improvements, dynamic routing to avoid busy superchargers; 
that&#x27;s actually really helpful.
    We take the real-time busyness of the stations into account when choosing where to navigate people on their road 
trip.
    And beyond that, we&#x27;re also continuing to improve the Trip Planner itself and how it estimates how much energy 
people use so it&#x27;s not too conservative and ask them to be able to charge more than they need to, which is another thing
that can delay a total trip.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, is Tesla considering any other ideas other than FSD with the real-world AI that can bring 
additional software revenue to Tesla?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; If not, can Tesla consider building interesting games around FSD Beta?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    At AI Day we did talk about potential future where Dojo could be used as a neural net training platform for other 
companies.
    It&#x27;s not a focus of ours today as we are fully subscribed on Dojo with our internal uses, we do expect to continue 
to improve the in-car experience in the context of FSD

Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you.
    And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how has FSD take rate change since the 
introduction of monthly subscription?
    Are there any plans to increase the FSD pricing as why the release becomes imminent?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll take the second part of the question first, we won&#x27;t be providing any forward-looking commentary on our pricing 
strategy or what may happen here over the near term.

    The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of 
the auto industry.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it&#x27;s underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
    And that&#x27;s why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people 
don&#x27;t realize that it has so much capability.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?</span>
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
    We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in 
the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of <span class="r2">2026</span> and ramping really throughout the year 
to full production.
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it&#x27;s really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
    Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with 
generation of record operating cash flows of $<span class="r2">6.3</span> billion.
    Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
    While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing 
incentives.
    As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and 
recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North </span>
<span class="r4">America, which contributed $</span><span class="r4">326</span><span class="r4"> million of revenues in the quarter.</span>
    We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $<span class="r2">2</span> billion of revenues so far this year.
    To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
    And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.
    As customers&#x27; acceptance of EV growth, we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling 
leads.
    Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory.
    To support this strategy, we&#x27;re continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in When you 
compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when 
you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, 
include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more.
    While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers 
but at times even with existing owners.

than it can cost.

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    Please go ahead.
    Adam Jonas

Hey, Elon.
    A question on LiDAR.
    If LiDAR were totally free, would you want to use it in your cars near-term?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Would that tech significantly help Tesla on the training of your neural network for FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

I mean totally free, probably not.
    I think probably -- I think even if it was free, we wouldn&#x27;t put it on.
    Adam Jonas

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s follow-up then.
    Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electric transport network of some ilk through some 
organic investments, but also Zuk, Aurora, Rivian, et cetera.
    What advice would you give Jeff Bezos in his endeavor?
    Elon Musk

Well, I don&#x27;t know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in.

    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
    We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at
a <span class="r2">50</span>% or greater compound annual growth rate.
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and </span>
<span class="r4">especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
    But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
