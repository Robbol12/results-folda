    But otherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yields more value 
than it can cost.

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    Please go ahead.

Hey, Elon.
    A question on LiDAR.
    If LiDAR were totally free, would you want to use it in your cars near-term?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Would that tech significantly help Tesla on the training of your neural network for FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

I mean totally free, probably not.
    I think probably -- I think even if it was free, we wouldn&#x27;t put it on.
    Adam Jonas

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s follow-up then.
    Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electric transport network of some ilk through some 
organic investments, but also Zuk, Aurora, Rivian, et cetera.
    What advice would you give Jeff Bezos in his endeavor?
    Elon Musk

Well, I don&#x27;t know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money in.
