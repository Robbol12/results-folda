profitability from FSD as predicted?

    Like if we can&#x27;t find a use for it, then we shouldn&#x27;t expect that others would.
    So, the first use of the Optimus robots would be, at Tesla, like moving parts around the factory or something like 
that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    And the next question on insurance.
    When do you plan on having your insurance service rolled out in all the states?
    International rollout timing?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In markets that have Tesla insurance, what kind of uptake rates are you seeing?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We currently offer Tesla Insurance in <span class="r2">5</span> states in the U.S. Four of them are telematics, which is Texas, Illinois, 
Ohio and Arizona.
    And then California, which has a more standard insurance offering based upon regulations there.
    Elon Musk

It should be clear, like we are pushing very hard for California to change the rules to allow informatics, which 
basically means that you&#x27;re as safe as you&#x27;re driving is measured.
    So, I think the current California rules are contrary to the best interest of the consumers in California and should
be changed.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And that&#x27;s evidenced by what we&#x27;re seeing in Texas.

    That&#x27;s the super -- and then actually do that, right -- that&#x27;s tough.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And the closer you are to applying blood, sweat and tears to actual production, the faster you&#x27;ll be able to bring new 
things into actual production.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    You want to tie it back with production, just like the office we&#x27;re sitting in right now, looks over the Giga Texas 
production line, like the offices are integrated into the factory.
    Martin Viecha

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I have two, please.
    First, you spoke a lot about FSD and how the economics could be very attractive going forward.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m wondering if you could just share what your current attach rate might be for FSD on your vehicles or how to </span>
<span class="r4">think about the progress of your attach rate or revenue in FSD, let&#x27;s say, in </span><span class="r4">&#x27;21 versus &#x27;20</span><span class="r4">?</span>
    And how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year?
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think the FSD stuff, you really don&#x27;t want to be looking at the rearview mirror.
    It will not be a good indicator for the future.
    This is what you need to look out the front windscreen, so -- because it is such a profound step change.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">296</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    As we look over the next a quarter or two, as I mentioned in my opening remarks in the last call as well, we have 
ramp inefficiencies from the launch of Austin and Berlin.
    We also have pressures coming from inflation, supply chain, raw materials, et cetera.
    And so, where that nets out is hard to say in the immediate term.
    And we obviously, as a company, are going to be driving to increase margins as much as we can.
    But I just want to be realistic that we&#x27;re launching two factories simultaneously here and it unavoidably will add 
cost to the business as we do that.
    And as we look further out, and Elon mentioned this in his opening remarks as well, the software portion of the 
business, I think, is the one to really pay attention to.
    As Full Self-Driving features get rolled out to more and more folks, I mean, for me, personally, I prefer to drive 
my car with the FSD data on.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think as more and more people experience that, take rates there, and then as we work towards the robotaxi </span>
<span class="r4">space, there&#x27;s actually quite a bit of upside on margins from a software perspective.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think basically everything pales in comparison to the value of robotaxi or personal driving.
    I mean, it&#x27;s just -- I mean, that just tends to warm everything.
    You just go from having an asset that is -- has a utility of perhaps <span class="r2">12</span> hours a week per passenger car to maybe 
around <span class="r2">50</span> or <span class="r2">60</span> hours a week to a 5x increase in the utility of the asset.
    The cost didn&#x27;t change.
    Yes.
    So, that&#x27;s where just things just we had -- just kind of where’s your mind.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">33</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Although we&#x27;re not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through <span class="r2">2022</span>, look at new locations
and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
    In <span class="r2">2022</span>, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
    So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
    And yes, so that&#x27;s -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
    And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I&#x27;m not sure what you do
for an encore to <span class="r2">2021</span>, <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in <span class="r2">2022</span> over <span class="r2">2021</span>, comfortably above <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    Full Self-Driving.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla.</span>
    It&#x27;s -- actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it&#x27;s kind of nutty -- it&#x27;s nutty good from a financial 
standpoint.
    And I think we are completely confident at this point that it will be achieved.
    And my personal guess is that we&#x27;ll achieve Full Self-Driving this year, yes, with data safety level significantly 
greater than present.
    So, it&#x27;s -- the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving by a software update, I think, might end up 
being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history.
    We shall see.
    It would also have a profound impact on improving safety and on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy 
through vastly better asset utilization.
    Let&#x27;s see.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">119</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Despite these constraints, it&#x27;s important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we are prepared once
limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.
    This will result in higher fixed and semi-variable costs in the near term, in addition to the usual inefficiencies 
as we ramp a new factory.
    We are also seeing inflation and rising commodity prices, which we expect to continue to put pressure on our costs.
    How this specifically impacts gross margins in the near term is uncertain, given a mix of both tailwinds and 
headwinds.
    However, we do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating 
leverage.
    Over a longer-term horizon, we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins, though.
    From the hardware side, we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce 
cost.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And with the rapid development of FSD, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the </span>
<span class="r4">profits generated by selling hardware.</span>
    So congratulations to the Tesla team for a terrific <span class="r2">2021</span>, and thank you to our suppliers who supported us.
    Looking forward to another great year.
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;d like to just second the thank you to suppliers.
    A lot of suppliers worked late nights, weekends, vacations around the world, and we&#x27;re very grateful for that.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to the Q&amp;A from the investor side.
    The first question was on <span class="r2">4680</span> cells, which we already answered.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">415</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year?
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think the FSD stuff, you really don&#x27;t want to be looking at the rearview mirror.
    It will not be a good indicator for the future.
    This is what you need to look out the front windscreen, so -- because it is such a profound step change.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, effectively long term, every car will have FSD.</span>
    And so, -- and the value of that will be a very big number.
    I just look at this as asset utilization.
    You have a passenger car, which normally is driven maybe <span class="r2">1.5</span> hours a day on average, maybe <span class="r2">10</span> -- <span class="r2">10</span> hours, <span class="r2">10</span>, <span class="r2">12</span> 
hours a week, a lot of cars are in parking lots.
    So, we&#x27;re spending money, not just driving the cars but storing them all over the place.
    We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.
    But there will be a challenge with traffic.
    So, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, and now I think 
it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because
you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of 
cars on the road.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">238</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we get direct feedback on whether driving is safe.
    And if they drive safe, their insurance cost is less, so they drive safer.
    It encourages Tesla Insurance with informatics and real-time feedback encourages safer driving and rewards it 
monetarily.
    It&#x27;s great.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Exactly.
    And so, we see that so far in Texas.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Take rates have been quite strong.</span>
    We measure this on the conversion rate from when folks quote to see what their monthly rate would be at the starting
point to what percentage of them purchase.
    So, we&#x27;re very encouraged by the interest that we&#x27;re seeing in Texas.
    And then we have enough history in Texas to see what does the loss ratios look like and how do the economics of the 
program work.
    And we&#x27;re on the right track there as well.
    So, we&#x27;re comfortable with what we&#x27;ve seen in Texas to move as quickly as the intent to scale this across the U.S.
    Specifically on the question about when we will be in all states, this is a slow process because of insurance being 
regulated at the state level.
    And so we have to go through each of those processes with each of the departments of insurance in each state.
