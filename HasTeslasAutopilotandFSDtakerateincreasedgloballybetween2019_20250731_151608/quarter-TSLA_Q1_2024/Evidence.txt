--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #15]  Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record **profitability** for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
2. [Sentence #28]  So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with **FSD** V12.
