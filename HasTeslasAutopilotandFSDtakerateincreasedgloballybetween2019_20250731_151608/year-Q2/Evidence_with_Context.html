    And from what we understand, and again, maybe I&#x27;m wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in 
images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.
    Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn&#x27;t have pedal -- pedals or 
a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can&#x27;t make it work, not because the regulators, 
they&#x27;re blaming regulators.
    That&#x27;s misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.
    So it&#x27;s just that their technology is not far.
    George Gianarikas

Right.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the </span>
<span class="r5">price.</span>
    Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly?
    Thank you.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, we shared the  that there we&#x27;ve seen a meaningful increase.
    I don&#x27;t want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results.
    And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can&#x27;t describe it till the time 
we actually use it.
    And that&#x27;s why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how 
this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is.
    I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there&#x27;s a bias example, but I have a more than <span class="r2">20</span> mile commute into 
the factory almost every day.

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO , and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very
difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
    But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
    And so that’s why I am confident we will get to <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year 
or early next year and probably but not certainly, <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.

    The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
    Colin, go ahead please.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality </span>
<span class="r5">rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5">?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
    I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the 
caveats associated with that can use it.
    Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
    The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
    It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
    Colin Rusch

Great.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

    So we do believe long-term in the value of Bitcoin.
    So it is our intent to hold what we have long-term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our 
customers as they purchase vehicles.
    Specifically, with respect to things we may do, there are things that we are constantly discussing.
    We are not planning to make any announcements here.
    We are watching this space closely.
    So when we are ready to make an announcement on this front, if there’s one to come, we will certainly let you all 
know.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s </span>
<span class="r5">imminent massive and deceptive click bait headline campaigns on safety of Autopilot or FSD, perhaps a specialty PR job </span>
<span class="r5">of some sort?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Well, I will take this one, guys.
    From the safety side, I continue to say, he is driving on too.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    Lars Moravy

Go ahead, Elon.
    Elon Musk

No.
    Please go ahead.
    I think, just with -- just going through the facts of what I mean, specifically, there were -- there was an article 
regarding a tragedy where there was a high speed accident in Tesla and it was really just extremely deceptive media 
practices where it was claimed to be Autopilot, which is completely false and those journalists should be ashamed of 
themselves.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2315</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span class="r5">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span class="r2">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1155</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next 
few months.
    To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the <span class="r2">2170</span> cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the <span class="r2">4680</span> 
questions later in this call.
    But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough <span class="r2">2170</span> cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of 
the year.
    So we are not dependent on <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
    That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas.
    And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over </span><span class="r5">100</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> owners.</span>
    They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.
    We have now driven over <span class="r2">35</span> million miles with FSD beta.
    That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than 
any – all other companies combined.
    So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
    With regard to manufacturing and technology, about <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years ago, we said we wanted to become the best 
manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our 
strongest competitive advantage.
    We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
    And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2338</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r2">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect </span>
<span class="r5">this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.</span>
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
    Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping 
Cybertruck and Model <span class="r2">3</span> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished 
goods.
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.

will also be produced here in Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

    Thank you.
    Just a couple more.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more 
detail on production plans?
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
    But we&#x27;re going to accelerate that.
    I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla to carry our own freight, probably mostly 
between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route.

    Colin, go ahead please.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
    Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality

    It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
    Colin Rusch

Great.
    And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
    But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the
elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly 
around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues 
with as you move into production?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span class="r5">12.5</span><span class="r5">, and maybe a </span><span class="r5">12.6</span><span class="r5">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>
<span class="r5">the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.</span>
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span class="r2">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.

    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.
    And I’m saying that would be in the U.S. because we’ve got to focus on one market first.
    But I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    I’ve been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the price of FSD -- so the great thing is the price of FSD is actually very low, it’s not high.</span>
    When you go back to what I said earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous.
    $<span class="r2">15</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> is actually a low price, not a high price.
    And we will offer -- and we -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most 
people don’t know that.
    So, I’d recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don’t have to go with the $<span class="r2">15</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> thing.
    But I think yes, yes -- obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $<span class="r2">15</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> is actually a low 
price for FSD.
    Martin Viecha

And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.
    William Stein

I’d like to ask about -- to stick on this AI topic.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">13</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1764</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.</span>
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2113</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span class="r2">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span class="r2">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span class="r2">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span class="r2">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>
<span class="r5">regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</span>

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?

    And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our 
computer, if they did not have the training data.
    So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net 
training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
    And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a <span class="r2">100</span> exaflops by the end of next year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, to date, over </span><span class="r5">300</span><span class="r5"> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.</span>
    That <span class="r2">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span class="r2">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, <span class="r2">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
    With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production
line in Austin.

    Super appreciate it.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial </span>
<span class="r5">progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the </span>
<span class="r5">quarter.</span>
    Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
    The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through
their initial ramps.
    Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
    I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
    You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
    On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to <span class="r2">27.9</span>%.
