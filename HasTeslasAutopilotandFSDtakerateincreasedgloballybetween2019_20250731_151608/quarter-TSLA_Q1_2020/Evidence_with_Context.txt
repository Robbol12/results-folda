[TSLA_Q1_2020] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2019 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

1. [Sentence #113] [PLAN]
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.
     It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
     And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
     So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
>>> Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
     What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
     For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
     Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
     I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
     And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
     In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.

Agree.
     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is – will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
