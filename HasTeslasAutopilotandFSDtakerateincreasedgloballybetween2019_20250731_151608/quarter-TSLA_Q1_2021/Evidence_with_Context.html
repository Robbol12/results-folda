    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between <span class="r2">2019</span> and <span class="r2">2024</span>, and did they achieve

    So we do believe long-term in the value of Bitcoin.
    So it is our intent to hold what we have long-term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our 
customers as they purchase vehicles.
    Specifically, with respect to things we may do, there are things that we are constantly discussing.
    We are not planning to make any announcements here.
    We are watching this space closely.
    So when we are ready to make an announcement on this front, if there’s one to come, we will certainly let you all 
know.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s </span>
<span class="r5">imminent massive and deceptive click bait headline campaigns on safety of Autopilot or FSD, perhaps a specialty PR job </span>
<span class="r5">of some sort?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Well, I will take this one, guys.
    From the safety side, I continue to say, he is driving on too.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    Lars Moravy

Go ahead, Elon.
    Elon Musk

No.
    Please go ahead.
    I think, just with -- just going through the facts of what I mean, specifically, there were -- there was an article 
regarding a tragedy where there was a high speed accident in Tesla and it was really just extremely deceptive media 
practices where it was claimed to be Autopilot, which is completely false and those journalists should be ashamed of 
themselves.
