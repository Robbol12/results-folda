[TSLA_Q1_2021] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2019 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

1. [Sentence #249] [PILOT]
     So we do believe long-term in the value of Bitcoin.
     So it is our intent to hold what we have long-term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles.
     Specifically, with respect to things we may do, there are things that we are constantly discussing.
     We are not planning to make any announcements here.
     We are watching this space closely.
     So when we are ready to make an announcement on this front, if there’s one to come, we will certainly let you all know.

Thank you.
>>> And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s imminent massive and deceptive click bait headline campaigns on safety of Autopilot or FSD, perhaps a specialty PR job of some sort?
     Lars Moravy

Well, I will take this one, guys.
     From the safety side, I continue to say, he is driving on too.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     Lars Moravy

Go ahead, Elon.
     Elon Musk

No.
     Please go ahead.
     I think, just with -- just going through the facts of what I mean, specifically, there were -- there was an article regarding a tragedy where there was a high speed accident in Tesla and it was really just extremely deceptive media practices where it was claimed to be Autopilot, which is completely false and those journalists should be ashamed of themselves.
