    Let&#x27;s go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.
    Go ahead and unmute.
    George Gianarikas

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span class="r5">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

    So we do believe long-term in the value of Bitcoin.
    So it is our intent to hold what we have long-term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our 
customers as they purchase vehicles.
    Specifically, with respect to things we may do, there are things that we are constantly discussing.
    We are not planning to make any announcements here.
    We are watching this space closely.
    So when we are ready to make an announcement on this front, if there’s one to come, we will certainly let you all

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s </span>

<span class="r5">of some sort?</span>

Well, I will take this one, guys.
    From the safety side, I continue to say, he is driving on too.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    Lars Moravy

Go ahead, Elon.
    Elon Musk

No.
    Please go ahead.
    I think, just with -- just going through the facts of what I mean, specifically, there were -- there was an article 
regarding a tragedy where there was a high speed accident in Tesla and it was really just extremely deceptive media 
practices where it was claimed to be Autopilot, which is completely false and those journalists should be ashamed of 
themselves.

    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,</span>
<span class="r5">which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, </span>
<span class="r5">most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot </span>
<span class="r5">features as we transition technologies.</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">113</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Question-and-Answer Session</span>

<span class="r5">A - Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r5">The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite </span>
<span class="r5">most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.</span>
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.

    Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.
    So we’ll have to wait till August.
    The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
    We already talked about that.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1582</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
    With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
    And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.
    Elon Musk

And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in 
Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on, okay, this is 
affecting my insurance rate or it isn’t.
    And so, when people see it -- they can see a real-time score, they realize, if I make the following changes in my 
driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for 
safer driving and an incentive to do so.
    So, it is -- actually, what we’re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is 
also net good.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon’s point, and premiums are lower.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We see that in the take rate data, we have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.</span>
    And I think I’ve talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us for these 
benefits.
    It’s bigger than just the economics.
    We’re trying to do a good thing here for our customers, save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency.
    It’s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash, both large or small, like we sort of see 
exactly what that caused.
    And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability
of that accident.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
    With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger 
capacity is really important.
    And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    Mark Delaney

Okay.
    That’s helpful.
    And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out 
in more states.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?</span>
    And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
    Maybe one step that I’ll share.
    So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
    But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
    And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.

    It&#x27;s not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it.
    We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to 
gigantic orders placed by every carmaker on earth.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
    And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
    Ben, go ahead and unmute.
    Ben, you&#x27;re still muted.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, I want to say again, we&#x27;d just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla </span>
<span class="r5">stock should really drive FSD </span><span class="r5">12.3</span><span class="r5">.</span>
    It really – you can&#x27;t – it&#x27;s impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.
    Martin Viecha

    So since Ben is not unmuting.
    Let&#x27;s try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research.
    Final question.
    Shreyas Patil

Thanks so much.
    Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would 
decline by <span class="r2">50</span>% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $<span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> of COGS.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span class="r5">150</span><span class="r5"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span class="r5">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.

    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2225</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span class="r2">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span class="r2">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
    It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras 
and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> on in North America.
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we now have over </span><span class="r5">300</span><span class="r5"> billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.</span>
    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span class="r2">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.
    And as we&#x27;ve announced, we&#x27;ll be showcasing our purpose-built Robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August.
    Yes.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">13</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1174</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span class="r2">9</span>
to <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about </span>
<span class="r5">increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our </span>
<span class="r5">vehicles is quite long.</span>
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.
    So, our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we’re aware 
of and believe will happen over the next <span class="r2">6</span> to <span class="r2">12</span> months.
    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.
    Martin Viecha

Raw material exposure?

Yes.

    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span class="r5">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span class="r5">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span class="r2">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span class="r2">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?</span>
    Thanks.

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the 
value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
