I think, it&#x27;s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country.
    We have a lot of a crumbling highways and bridges.
    And frankly, when I visit China, I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours.
    It&#x27;s great.
    Europe has better infrastructure.
    It&#x27;s really quite sad that U.S. infrastructure especially it’s roads and highways is where it is today.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And our airports, in a lot of cases, are an embarrassment.</span>
    So -- and it&#x27;s not just a question of money.
    It&#x27;s a question of will.
    Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it?
    So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation
of the past.
    If this was <span class="r2">1920</span>, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
    Obviously that’s not steam engines.
    So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people&#x27;s rights, as what
is happening right now.

    It will certainly be within three months and possibly one month.
    And that would be in the U.S.
    So as for how many will be in five years, I&#x27;m not – I don&#x27;t know right now what that number would be.
    I guess, several more than there are today.
    But I&#x27;m not sure, what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.
    And --

Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Larger, they start being called Tera.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, with multiple products as well.
    And so the absolute number of Giga factories, we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is larger.
    And that&#x27;s under our belief that just significant efficiencies by having as much as possible, and similar product 
lines under the same roof, and as much vertical integration as possible all in one facility.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you give us an update on Solar Roof ramp?
    How many are you currently able to install per week?
    What is your installations per week target for the end of <span class="r2">2021</span>?

    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r2">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
    Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to <span class="r2">10</span> years?
    This would be <span class="r2">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span> and more than <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2030</span>.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is </span><span class="r5">40</span><span class="r5">% or more realistic target?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r2">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r2">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r2">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">74</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2024]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.</span>
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">198</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2021]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been 
released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
    And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
    So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.</span>
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r2">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already </span>
<span class="r5">lower than the cost to produce the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.</span>
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">374</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so that helps create some of the margin.</span>
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r2">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
    And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model <span class="r2">3</span> as well, and so we have experience with
that both with Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">223</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    We may not – as soon as next month.
    This is not a prediction, just saying.
    That&#x27;s – that could happen.
    It will certainly be within three months and possibly one month.
    And that would be in the U.S.
    So as for how many will be in five years, I&#x27;m not – I don&#x27;t know right now what that number would be.
    I guess, several more than there are today.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m not sure, what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today.</span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s a fair question.
    I don&#x27;t have any additional color to provide.
    So $<span class="r2">8.1</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we&#x27;re managing it very closely.
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver
at the end of Q1.
    So we&#x27;re making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
    And as we&#x27;ve been looking at liquidity, we&#x27;ve been looking at this over the next <span class="r2">18</span> months, and there&#x27;s ups and 
downs to the liquidity.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently now, as we&#x27;re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we&#x27;re paying off.</span>
    But then in a couple of months, we&#x27;ll quickly be through that, and then we&#x27;ll have a gap in payables since we don&#x27;t 
have any parts coming in.
    So it does go up and down a little bit.
    But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we&#x27;re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with 
the liquidity position of the company.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be 
identified as a serious risk.
    We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the 
vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the <span class="r2">3</span> and all of the Y.
    So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes 
against all their constitutional rights, that in my opinion, and breaking people&#x27;s freedoms in ways that are horrible 
and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the fuck?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Then we have a global QA team, which I&#x27;m on, actually.
    I&#x27;m one of -- on the global QA team.
    And we test the releases in the real world, the essence of real-world in a simulation, which is -- which are very 
many, because the world is very complex and where -- and then we release it to a small group of private beta testers 
within the company; then to a larger audience, including people outside the company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; 
and then finally, a broad release.
    And so there are many stages that these things go through.
    So, by the time something is being -- going to wide release into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages.
    And the software that&#x27;s at the very early stage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.
    So, just going to go through a very rigorous safety process.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in </span>
<span class="r5">intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that </span>
<span class="r5">kind of thing, when those eventually come back.</span>
    Those are extra hard cases.
    But it&#x27;s all tracking very well.
    If you like, the water pallets engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I&#x27;m deeply 
involved with the team.
    So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
    So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we&#x27;re headed.
    And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we&#x27;ll have the functionality that’s really cool, also 
driving by the end of the year.
    Now after that functionality is released, there&#x27;s still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, 
once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.

    Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
    Please go ahead.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
    Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is 
already positive at such low volume.
    How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model <span class="r2">3</span>, what other factors should we think about?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?</span>
    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.

    I was asking about Mr. Mizuho entering the Board and kind of the process behind that and what he brings to the 
Board?
    Elon Musk

I think we all need to go.
    And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done 
great work as -- at the Japan Pension Fund, which is the largest fund of any kind in the world.
    And generally, the conversations over the years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the 
global security markets work and what he thinks it is, whether are historical.
    It just -- it seems like he has a strong philosophical understanding about how to make the future better.
    And he shares our view regarding the environment and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the 
Board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people.
    Ben Kallo

I guess leaking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And is there any read-through on bringing him on to the Board?</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

No.
    I think this is set right through with the Panasonic relationship.
    I mean, I have a great relationship with Panasonic&#x27;s CEO.
    We meet regularly one on one and talk at the time.
    So, that relationship is strong.
    Just that he&#x27;d bring more of a broader and a global, strategic view to the Board.

    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.</span>
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.

    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.

    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.

    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.

    And as a result, it had a <span class="r2">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r2">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r2">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.</span>
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.

    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r2">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.

    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in </span>
<span class="r5">March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.</span>
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.

    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.

    Elon Musk

I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
    We may not – as soon as next month.
    This is not a prediction, just saying.
    That&#x27;s – that could happen.
    It will certainly be within three months and possibly one month.
    And that would be in the U.S.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So as for how many will be in five years, I&#x27;m not – I don&#x27;t know right now what that number would be.</span>
    I guess, several more than there are today.
    But I&#x27;m not sure, what exactly it would be in five years, but some number more than today.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I&#x27;ll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.
    And --

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Larger, they start being called Tera.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, with multiple products as well.
    And so the absolute number of Giga factories, we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is larger.

    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard
to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice.
    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Production is good.</span>
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week.
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.

<span class="r5">A - Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r5">The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite </span>
<span class="r5">most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.</span>
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.

    Is <span class="r2">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r2">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r2">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r2">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r2">3</span>.

    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of </span>
<span class="r5">production.</span>
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
    Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car 
and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
    That&#x27;s it.
    Effortless.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And many customers do that.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">And they&#x27;re doing it, yes.</span>
    In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because 
normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
    When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, 
then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or 
something on Amazon and -- except it&#x27;s a car.
    Yes.
    All right.
    And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in <span class="r2">90</span> seconds, so.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally 
highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and time line for introduction?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">30</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">323</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And as we&#x27;ve been looking at liquidity, we&#x27;ve been looking at this over the next <span class="r2">18</span> months, and there&#x27;s ups and 
downs to the liquidity.
    Currently now, as we&#x27;re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we&#x27;re paying off.
    But then in a couple of months, we&#x27;ll quickly be through that, and then we&#x27;ll have a gap in payables since we don&#x27;t 
have any parts coming in.
    So it does go up and down a little bit.
    But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we&#x27;re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with 
the liquidity position of the company.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be 
identified as a serious risk.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the </span>
<span class="r5">vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and all of the Y.</span>
    So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes 
against all their constitutional rights, that in my opinion, and breaking people&#x27;s freedoms in ways that are horrible 
and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the fuck?
    Excuse me.
    But outrage -- it’s an outrage.
    So -- but it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies.
    And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not.
    And all peoples -- everything people have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real 
time.
    And we&#x27;re going to have many suppliers -- or have many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the 
small ones, and it&#x27;s causing a lot of strife to a lot of people.
