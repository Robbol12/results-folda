[Multi-Year Analysis] Has Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD take rate increased globally between 2019 and 2024, and did they achieve profitability from FSD as predicted?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #2]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Regarding **Autopilot** and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with **FSD** beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
2. [Sentence #27]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Regarding **Autopilot**, we have now deployed our **FSD** beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.
3. [Sentence #54]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised **FSD** essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
4. [Sentence #59]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as **increased** deferred revenue for certain **Autopilot** features as we transition technologies.
5. [Sentence #74]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, the ****take** **rate**** for **FSD** has improved substantially, especially after the 10/10 event.
6. [Sentence #77]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Since the revision of **FSD** pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
7. [Sentence #113]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience **FSD**, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
8. [Sentence #123]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

The **rate** card for California Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with **Autopilot**.
9. [Sentence #140]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And we're really only getting to **take** full advantage of the **Autopilot** hardware and the **FSD** hardware.
10. [Sentence #142]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) This would be a huge for loyalty and overall **increased** sales of vehicles who are offering more **FSD** sales on used vehicles.
11. [Sentence #144]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We do actually offer an **increased** – higher price than for a car with **FSD** than one without **FSD**.
12. [Sentence #167]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license **FSD**?
13. [Sentence #198]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does **FSD** ****take** **rate**** -- how has **FSD** ****take** **rate**** change since the introduction of monthly subscription?
14. [Sentence #205]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And as a result of that, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront ****take** **rate**** of **FSD** when people when people purchase cars.
15. [Sentence #211]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing **FSD** in the future?
16. [Sentence #221]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) In markets that have Tesla insurance, what kind of uptake rates are you seeing?
17. [Sentence #223]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your **FSD** **take** rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there?
18. [Sentence #226]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the **FSD** ****take** **rate****, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
19. [Sentence #226]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there's a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has **FSD** compared to one that doesn't.
20. [Sentence #247]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And so I’m wondering how you **take** that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of **FSD** over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
21. [Sentence #249]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s imminent massive and deceptive click bait headline campaigns on safety of **Autopilot** or **FSD**, perhaps a specialty PR job of some sort?
22. [Sentence #249]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) And the fourth question from retail investors is, does Tesla have any proactive plans to tackle main stream media’s imminent massive and deceptive click bait headline campaigns on safety of **Autopilot** or **FSD**, perhaps a specialty PR job of some sort?
23. [Sentence #317]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And what we're seeing in initial ****take** **rate**** data is that, if you compare that to what we're seeing in California, we're off to a good start here.
24. [Sentence #323]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) And when does Tesla expect to reach that **rate**?
25. [Sentence #343]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the ****take** **rate**** of **FSD** today?
26. [Sentence #344]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So do you already see that people are getting more excited by **FSD**, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the ****take** **rate****?
27. [Sentence #366]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) As full self-driving matures, as **take** rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.
28. [Sentence #374]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that **FSD** **take** rates were up materially after you reduced the price.
29. [Sentence #424]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of **FSD**?
30. [Sentence #452]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around **FSD**, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the **increased** cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
