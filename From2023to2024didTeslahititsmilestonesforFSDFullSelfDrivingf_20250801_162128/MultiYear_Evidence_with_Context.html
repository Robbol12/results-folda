ood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla&#x27;s First Quarter <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> Q&amp;A Webcast.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I&#x27;m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">of other executives.</span>
    Our Q1 results were announced at about <span style="color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold">3:00</span> P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as 
this webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.

    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Great.
    And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out of Shanghai.
    Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocate more vehicles to Southeast
Asia, Australia, other areas.
    I&#x27;m just wondering what other regions do you think you&#x27;re maybe not yet serving effectively?
    What are your timelines for addressing some of those gaps in your regional exposure?
    Thanks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Yes.</span>
    That&#x27;s a good question because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet serve with respect to 
vehicles especially.
    So we do expect to open up new markets around the world.
    And while those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up to add a whole bunch of markets.
    They do collectively sum up to something significant.
    So it&#x27;s high time that Tesla operates its cars to the rest of the world, and that is something that we intend to do.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
    We think there&#x27;ll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.
    It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And that&#x27;s the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">second half of the year.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.

    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
    Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.</span>
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">159</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And so, as the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell 
portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
    A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
    It does not have <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.
    And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost 
reduction in the Berlin factory as well.
    In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don&#x27;t need to rehash it, but the expectation is that 
every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.
    There&#x27;s also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we&#x27;re 
aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
    Within the world that we don&#x27;t control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in 
our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage 
of reduced spot rates where they can.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So thank you to our supply chain team.</span>
    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

    And that&#x27;s the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.
    So that&#x27;s what it looks like.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.</span>
    George Gianarikas

Thank you.
    Maybe on the dramatic change we&#x27;ve seen in EV-related commodity prices.
    Do you think it&#x27;s a reflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining, or is that sort of a coincident 
indicator on global EV demand?
    And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next several quarters?
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Man, I wish I had a crystal ball to answer your question.
    I don&#x27;t know if we can provide a question that would -- with -- that would have any value really.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we&#x27;re already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated a crash in the 
lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonate reductions into battery cost.
    And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide.
    The length of the supply chain matters also because what we&#x27;re talking about is very far upstream.
    So by the time it makes sense that battery that ends up in car.
    It will be several months.
    But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we&#x27;re also very focused on other metrics that make
production very efficient.
    So, for example, detention and demurrage air expedites.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think our air expedites are down </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">90</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    Detention and demurrage is down <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">93</span>% from the peaks.
    That can be hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle.
    So we&#x27;re sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.
    Colin Rusch

Okay.
    And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
    I mean, obviously, there&#x27;s a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.

    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

I mean -- yes, I don&#x27;t -- that&#x27;s also not exactly how we look at it, really.
    We&#x27;re not like -- yes, we&#x27;re not engaged in the interconnection queue.
    Like we&#x27;re focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the 
pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our
own projects.
    And we&#x27;re mostly just -- we&#x27;re being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our 
mission and our objectives.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This -- again, this is not a product call, but we&#x27;ll have something, I mean, this -- we&#x27;re making improvements on 
many fronts, including Megapacks.

    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.</span>
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.

    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
    And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell, which is an input into 
our Austin COGS.
    And so, as the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell 
portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
    A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
    It does not have <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">reduction in the Berlin factory as well.</span>
    In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don&#x27;t need to rehash it, but the expectation is that 
every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.
    There&#x27;s also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we&#x27;re 
aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
    Within the world that we don&#x27;t control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in 
our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage 
of reduced spot rates where they can.
    So thank you to our supply chain team.
    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.

    And we have the technology that&#x27;s really good.
    But it&#x27;s still – it&#x27;s a back burner item.
    Our focus is very much on vehicles, autonomy, stationary storage, basically solving sustainable energy and solving 
autonomy, which would be like – solving autonomy, if we&#x27;re able to have a fleet of several million vehicles that with a 
software update can be potentially worth several times their original value, that&#x27;s – that will be – if that happens, 
that will be the – and I think it will happen, that will be the biggest asset value increase in history, I think.

    Moving to sort of pricing, but a lot of pundits talk about the pie and losing share or gaining share.
    But how do you guys look at pricing versus the EVs or price vehicles, or does that not come into the equation?
    Sorry to ask about pricing again.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.</span>
    Elon Musk

No, it&#x27;s really just like – every day, we get a daily real-time update of how many cars were ordered yesterday, how many
cars were produced yesterday.
    We must have – if there&#x27;s a company that&#x27;s got more real-time data than Tesla – I&#x27;m not sure, there&#x27;s any company on
earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink.
    So – because like we don&#x27;t have to -- for the other car companies, they will make the cars, send them to the dealers
then the dealers will sell the cars.
    And then it takes quite a long time for them to get the data back to actually figure out how many cars were sold.
    Whereas we know how many cars were ordered yesterday throughout the world.
    So our fingers on the pulse is real-time and does not have latency, whereas the other car companies have a lot of 
latency in their data.
    As does the government, the government has a lot of latency in their data.

    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.

    And should we think about -- going forward, you need to look into the agency or using importers to basically develop
market share more smoothly, I guess, globally?
    And so in other words, is there kind of fell by date for the direct business model as you practice it today?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Seems to be working well so far because we hear different feedback from customers who miss the human interaction or 
unhappy with the service, and I&#x27;m just wondering if you&#x27;re seeing some growth pains in there that would lead you to 
change.
    You&#x27;re not seeing that?
    Elon Musk

Well, I mean, there are -- since we&#x27;re always going to have some growing pains where at times -- and it depends on which
geography we&#x27;re talking about where sometimes service is behind sales, sometimes it&#x27;s ahead of sales.
    This is -- I mean, Telsa&#x27;s growing, I believe, faster than any company in history that makes a large complex 
manufactured object.
    So these are – as you try to max – it&#x27;s always difficult to match exponentials.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So – but I think it is helpful to have the feedback loop with a service because that means we feel the pain of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">service, and then we can address the design to make the car need less service.</span>
    And I think that gives us the right incentive structure, like because the best service is no service.
    The car doesn&#x27;t break.
    And whereas if you have say a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then you arguably have a 
misalignment of incentives where they&#x27;re making money on service.
    But actually, we want to – the best thing for the consumer is the car doesn&#x27;t need servicing so.
    Philippe Houchois

Yeah.
    And then last one, if I can follow up.
    Have you worked out, I mean, for many of your traditional competitors, a fair amount of profits for them comes from 
selling spare parts and servicing, and you don&#x27;t have that in your profit structure.

Lithium has dropped a lot.
    It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And that&#x27;s the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
    And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the 
second half of the year.

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.

    George Gianarikas

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

Hey guys.
    When you talk about manifest supply, you talked about Dojo being a product that you can sell outside of Tesla.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How do we rank all the things you have going on and then in the economic environment?</span>
    I mean, like heat pumps and everything else you have going on versus investing in the vehicle business, or is that 
not the right way to look at it?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand your question, but I&#x27;d look at Dojo as like kind of a long-shot bet, but if it&#x27;s a 
long-shot bet that pays off, it will pay off in a very, very big way.
    But potentially, yeah, potentially in a very, very big way, Like in the multi-hundred billion dollar level.
    But I think it&#x27;s like still put it in the long shot category, but long shot with a multi-hundred billion dollar 
potential outcome.
    And – so it&#x27;s a bet worth making, but not one you can sort of say like or take it to the bank type of thing.
    Although, these days take it to the bank, it&#x27;s maybe not as secure as it used to be.
    So obviously, big believes in heat pumps.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So that&#x27;s -- so it&#x27;s just almost directly equivalent to a price increase, is there any kind of interest rate 
increase.
    Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generally postpone new -- big, 
new capital purchases like a new car.
    This is a natural human reaction.
    So if people are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they&#x27;re like, well, they might be worried about -- 
they might be laid off.
    So then there&#x27;ll be naturally a little more hesitant than they would otherwise be to buy a new car.
    Now this is just the nature of the auto industry.
    But there is -- there will be a trans amount of pent-up demand for new cars.

    And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the 
small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there.
    But as this business grows and smooths out, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re that far away from it.
    I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we&#x27;ll start doing
and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.

    While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business 
will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.
    We generally look to mid-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% gross margins for any program that we launch.

    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
    And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.</span>
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
    I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.
    I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business.
    Relative to total revenues of the company, it&#x27;s still fairly small.

    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving

    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.</span>
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
    Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

    And Zach has some remarks as well.

    So we&#x27;re sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.
    Colin Rusch

Okay.
    And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
    I mean, obviously, there&#x27;s a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?
    And how much of that is converting into actual sales?
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">I mean -- yes, I don&#x27;t -- that&#x27;s also not exactly how we look at it, really.</span>
    We&#x27;re not like -- yes, we&#x27;re not engaged in the interconnection queue.
    Like we&#x27;re focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the 
pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our
own projects.
    And we&#x27;re mostly just -- we&#x27;re being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our 
mission and our objectives.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This -- again, this is not a product call, but we&#x27;ll have something, I mean, this -- we&#x27;re making improvements on 
many fronts, including Megapacks.
    So I think some of those improvements will improve the speed at which you can connect the Megapacks to the grid.
    Martin Viecha

    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.</span>
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.

    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
