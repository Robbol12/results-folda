    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2892</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4025</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3546</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?</span>
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
    Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.</span>
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
    But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same 
because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
    So, if we&#x27;d actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on
that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
    And the same is true of this year.
    So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
    It would not make any sense because we&#x27;ll still be part constrained.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.</span>
    That is most likely.
    But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
    So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we&#x27;re doing this year 
is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
    This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
    If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
    Capital equipment is distilled labor.
    So, what happens if you don&#x27;t actually have a labor shortage?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cars to Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>?
    Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And to be clear, for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will so far exceed the average -- 
the safety of the average human.

    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>

    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>

    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?

    Elon Musk

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
    So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
    I’ll be there in person.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.</span>
    That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>-mile range.
    Just to be clear, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> miles with the cargo.

Thank you.
    And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how do you balance the need for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> Model Y?

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
    And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.

    Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
    It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited 
about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
    Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.</span>
    And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire 
supply chain.
    The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount 
battery output per year?
    This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the 
pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
    So yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
    I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
    And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as 
possible?

    So Q1 <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">factories.</span>
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.

    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; First is regarding the Cybertruck.</span>
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
    Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.

    It&#x27;s not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
    Millions of cars suddenly have about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times utility  overnight.
    I don&#x27;t actually know how to quantify that financially except that it&#x27;s some big number.
    Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
    You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year or better.
    That would put you at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.2</span> million vehicles or more in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">250</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicles.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">missing in that equation?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, it&#x27;s apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
    If an asset has <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times more utilization than the -- it&#x27;s like dividing the cost of that asset by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>.
    So, if you have a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car, it&#x27;s like having a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because 
still you don&#x27;t want to drive.
    So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
    So, it&#x27;s probably better than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times, I don&#x27;t know.
    Yes.

    So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
    As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.</span>
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.

    I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
    Prototypes are trivial.
    They are child’s play.
    Production is hard.
    It is very hard.
    Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low-cost, insanely difficult.
    But what Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume </span>

    So this is -- this -- basically myself and NIO and Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
    It was so hard.
    You have no idea.
    So anyway, and the thing about making a large complex manufactured object is let’s say that you have a closer 
approximation <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> unique items.
    If even one of those items is slow, that sets your rate, just one.
    Isn’t that so trivial?

    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.

    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">credits for battery cells packs?</span>
    So $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">700</span> per long-range Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">45</span> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much 
does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.

    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
    Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.</span>
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.

    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in </span>

    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.

    Let’s go to the next one.
    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
    First is regarding the Cybertruck.
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
    We still have cells in <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>

Elon Musk

Mention count.
    Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any 
other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
