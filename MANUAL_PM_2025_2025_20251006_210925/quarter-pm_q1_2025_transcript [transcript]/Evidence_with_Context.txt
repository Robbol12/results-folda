[PM_Q1_2025_transcript [Transcript]] tariffs

1. [Sentence #166] [PLAN]
     Both Marlboro and our global brand portfolio reached all-time first quarter highs.
     We continue to target broadly stable category share over time, with our main priorities being maximizing value and supporting the growth of smoke-free products.
     Most importantly, combustible organic gross profits continued to grow robustly at plus 5.3% following the recovery of 2024.
     This brings us to our outlook for 2025.
     We delivered a very strong first quarter, including better-than-expected margins, and we remain confident we will achieve another year of superior growth.
     As such, we are reconfirming the currency-neutral growth outlook we provided in February, despite a backdrop of increased uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment.
     As a global company with broadly diversified production and a worldwide sectorial network, including an established U.S. manufacturing base, we believe we are well positioned to mitigate potential supply chain challenges.
>>> While the situation is volatile, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our business from recently introduced or discussed tariffs.
     We expect a continuation of strong momentum from our smoke-free business, including the benefits of further multi-category deployment.
     As I explained, we are raising our forecast for U.S. in shipment to 800 to 840 million cans.
     This further supports our forecast of plus 12% to plus 14% SFP shipment growth, which incorporates unchanged strong growth assumptions for IQOS.
     We also continue to expect total semi-organic net revenue growth in the range of plus 6% to plus 8%, organic operating income growth of plus 10.5% to plus 12.5%, and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10.5% to plus 12.5%.
     As announced in this morning's press release, we are raising our 2025 adjusted diluted EPS forecast to $7.36 to $7.49.
     This now reflects plus 12% to plus 14% growth in dollar terms, and includes a favorable estimated currency impact of $0.10 at the value exchange rate.
     This reflects recent strength in the Euro, Japanese yen, and Russian rubles, vastly offset by a stronger Swiss Franc.
