    But we’ve got a team of about <span class="r2">120</span> people in our software AI group that are extremely talented.
    And I think we will have – I’m highly confident we will solve full self-driving and it still seems to be this year.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how is the <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp going?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And is Giga Texas producing cells yet?</span>
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    So we are making progress on <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveraging supplier cells, which we have in sufficient quantity to ramp 
Texas and Berlin.
    We expect to ramp total <span class="r2">4680</span> production to exceed <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> per week by the end of the year, hopefully before – well 
before.
    In Q2, at Kato, we fully automated  for the drying of electrode tool there, unlocking major increases in production 
and improvements in yields.
    Since March because of that, Kato output has grown about <span class="r2">35</span>% month-over-month each month since, and yields 
throughout the factory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others.
    We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai.
    And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
    I do want to emphasize this was obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control.
    The past few years have been quite a few force majeures and it’s been kind of supply chain hell for several years.
    Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming entirely difficult challenges and huge thanks to the 
Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacrificed a lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record 
output.
    So, also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin.
    We achieved an important milestone of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week in June.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next </span>
<span class="r4">few months.</span>
    To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the <span class="r2">2170</span> cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the <span class="r2">4680</span> 
questions later in this call.
    But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough <span class="r2">2170</span> cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of 
the year.
    So we are not dependent on <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
    That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas.
    And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
    Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> owners.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter.
    Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial 
progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the 
quarter.
    Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through</span>
<span class="r4">their initial ramps.</span>
    Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
    I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
    You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
    On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to <span class="r2">27.9</span>%.
    The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and 
factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
    Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, 
which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity.
    Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content.
    For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin.
    Specific to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first 
commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line.
    Our target for Texas is to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly 
output before the end of this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is on <span class="r2">4680</span> as well, but I think Drew has covered everything that was in the next question.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin.</span>
    How is the situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components?
    How about cost inflation impacting profitability of these other plants?
    Andrew Baglino

I can take that.
    So Tesla procures about <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">600</span> unique pieces of silicon from <span class="r2">43</span> semiconductor companies.
    So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges.
    Things are more stable on the latest generation chips.
    We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors, especially in the analog and mixed signal space.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">725</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another – a bunch of other companies to put in 
place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.
    We’re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great.
    Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless.
    So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it’s about the same size and magnitude as
the IRA benefits that we also received.
    Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there’s two things to 
keep in mind there.
    The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2.
    So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it’s important to adjust for that.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that </span>
<span class="r4">from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere.</span>
    And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased.
    And so, that’s something to consider as you model out the impact on – from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.
    I do want to ask Karn if there’s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yes.
    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory.
    But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongest quarters in our history.
    Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai.
    And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.

    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost</span>

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
    Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.

    Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
    It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited 
about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
    Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.</span>
    And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire 
supply chain.
    The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount 
battery output per year?
    This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the 
pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
    So yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
    I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
    And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as 
possible?

    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r2">20</span> years of

<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in Texas, </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell production increased </span><span class="r4">80</span><span class="r4">% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> million production cells </span>
<span class="r4">produced here in Texas.</span>
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
