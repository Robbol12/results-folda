We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Like just to emphasize on that, we&#x27;ve started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA,</span>
<span class="r5">general assembly, body shops.</span>
    We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
    How many are needed on each continent?

    Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline 
improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span>?
    Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
    I don&#x27;t want to blow your minds, but I&#x27;m often optimistic regarding time.
    But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    So sometime in the second half.
    That&#x27;s just what our current schedule says.
    But there&#x27;s a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the </span>
<span class="r5">engineers to be living on the line.</span>
    This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
    And it&#x27;s just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it&#x27;s in Austin versus elsewhere.
    So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
    That will be a challenging production ramp.
    Like, as I can emphasize we&#x27;ll be sleeping on the line practically.
    In fact, not practically.
    We will be.

    Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won&#x27;t be growing at the same rate as before.
    We are between two major growth waves.
    The first one began with the global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with 
the next generation platform.
    In <span class="r2">2024</span>, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of 
the next generation vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is from Michael.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of </span>
<span class="r5">these to produce their first products such as </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span class="r2">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span class="r2">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span class="r2">3</span>.

    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So a much easier situation.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly </span>
<span class="r5">improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.</span>
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
    Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop </span>
<span class="r5">commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.</span>
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells reached <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells by another <span class="r2">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.

    I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a 
volatile year.
    On a full year basis: revenue increased over <span class="r2">50</span>%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over <span class="r2">50</span>%, and 
our margins remained industry-leading.
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span class="r2">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span class="r2">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell </span>
<span class="r5">production factories.</span>
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span class="r2">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">273</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to two million vehicles, but we were saying <span class="r2">1.8</span> 
million, because -- I don&#x27;t know, it just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on earth.
    And we don&#x27;t control if there&#x27;s like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera.
    So, if it&#x27;s a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have
the potential to do <span class="r2">2</span> million cars this year.
    We&#x27;re not committing to that, but I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s the potential.
    So – and I think there would be demand for that, too.
    Rod Lache

Yeah.
    Thanks for clarifying that.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> ramp,</span>
<span class="r5">the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate.</span>
    Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you&#x27;re absorbing from those things like you did last 
quarter?
    And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs 
are headed from this announcement that you just made last night?
    If I&#x27;m correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I&#x27;ve seen anywhere 
else, maybe $<span class="r2">30</span> a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we want to say the specific number, but it&#x27;s interesting, if you look at the size of the – of Giga Nevada 
that is allocated to make <span class="r2">100</span> gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about <span class="r2">35</span>.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, the goals we&#x27;ve outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I 
mean, that&#x27;s been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.

were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
    And just a brief update from the business perspective.
    Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through <span class="r9">&#x27;24 and &#x27;</span><span class="r2">25</span>.
    We want to thank all of our partners who&#x27;ve put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical

    Pierre Ferragu

Excellent.
    Zach, actually, I&#x27;d like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost.
    If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $<span class="r2">36</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> in the middle of <span class="r2">2021</span>.
    And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas.
    And this quarter, I think we are close to $<span class="r2">40</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and we peaked maybe close to $<span class="r2">42</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> at some point last year.
    And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $<span class="r2">36</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, which 
would mean Berlin and Texas and those input costs, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like
a kind of like a <span class="r2">10</span>% decline in the COGS per car?
    Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of </span>
<span class="r5">the year, and that&#x27;s within Tesla&#x27;s control.</span>
    We&#x27;re doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that.
    And we talked about supply chain costs, expedite, logistics, attacking everything.
    On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of
cost increase for us, we&#x27;ll have to see where lithium prices go.
    And we&#x27;re not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, is what we&#x27;ve seen from our forecast here, 
cost per car of lithium in <span class="r2">2023</span> will be higher than <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    So that&#x27;s a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels.
    So, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get there this year, but I think we&#x27;ll make progress.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don&#x27;t have control over.

    Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span class="r2">4680</span> team for achieving <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of </span>
<span class="r5">commissioning and install.</span>
    Really, our <span class="r2">2023</span> goal as a <span class="r2">4680</span> team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span class="r2">4680</span> year in
<span class="r2">2024</span>.

    It&#x27;s not something we -- I think we&#x27;ll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we&#x27;re 
thinking about very carefully.
    I really kind of like what is the fastest path to <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>-gigawatt-hours a year of production.

    And we&#x27;re very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
    Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be 
manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then </span>
<span class="r5">we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.</span>
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
    In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite 
of a very high interest rate environment.
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking

    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order

    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production </span>
<span class="r5">credits for battery cells packs?</span>
    So $<span class="r2">3</span>,<span class="r2">700</span> per long-range Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $<span class="r2">45</span> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much 
does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.

<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">41</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding batteries, production rate of </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells reached </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re </span>
<span class="r5">increasing capacity for </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells by another </span><span class="r5">100</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.</span>
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
    So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
    And we&#x27;ve got an amazing plan for making the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell low-cost and high energy density.
    So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
