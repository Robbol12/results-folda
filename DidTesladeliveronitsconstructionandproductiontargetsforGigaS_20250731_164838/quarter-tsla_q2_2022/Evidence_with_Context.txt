[TSLA_Q2_2022] Did Tesla deliver on its construction and production targets for Giga Shanghai, Giga Berlin, and Giga Texas between 2022 and 2023?

1. [Sentence #254] [PLAN]
     But we’ve got a team of about 120 people in our software AI group that are extremely talented.
     And I think we will have – I’m highly confident we will solve full self-driving and it still seems to be this year.
     I know people are like says that.
     But it does seem to be epic.
     It does seem as though we are converging on solving full self-driving this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how is the 4680 ramp going?
>>> And is Giga Texas producing cells yet?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     So we are making progress on 4680.
     But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveraging supplier cells, which we have in sufficient quantity to ramp Texas and Berlin.
     We expect to ramp total 4680 production to exceed 1,000 per week by the end of the year, hopefully before – well before.
     In Q2, at Kato, we fully automated [indiscernible] for the drying of electrode tool there, unlocking major increases in production and improvements in yields.
     Since March because of that, Kato output has grown about 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout the factory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others.
     We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy.

2. [Sentence #20] [PILOT]
     Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai.
     And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
     I do want to emphasize this was obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control.
     The past few years have been quite a few force majeures and it’s been kind of supply chain hell for several years.
     Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming entirely difficult challenges and huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacrificed a lot to get the factory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.
     So, also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin.
     We achieved an important milestone of 1,000 cars a week in June.
>>> And we are expecting – sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the 1,000 vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next few months.
     To be clear, we are currently making the cars with the 2170 cells and Drew Baglino will address some of the 4680 questions later in this call.
     But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year.
     So we are not dependent on 4680.
     4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
     That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas.
     And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
     Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent execution during the second quarter.
     Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business, and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.
     Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records.
>>> The Shanghai factory resumed full production and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing well through their initial ramps.
     Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross profit with the highest solar volumes in many years.
     I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.
     You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
     On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
     The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
     Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.

     Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity.
     Manufacturing lines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content.
     For these reasons, there are some new ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin.
     Specific to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and we produced our first commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line.
     Our target for Texas is to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly output before the end of this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Drew has covered everything that was in the next question.
>>> So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin.
     How is the situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components?
     How about cost inflation impacting profitability of these other plants?
     Andrew Baglino

I can take that.
     So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductor companies.
     So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges.
     Things are more stable on the latest generation chips.
     We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors, especially in the analog and mixed signal space.

     So, just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolonged shutdown of our Shanghai factory.
     But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongest quarters in our history.
     Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremont and Shanghai.
     And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.
     I do want to emphasize this was obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control.

     Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
     It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
     Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
>>> The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
     And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain.
     The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount battery output per year?
     This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
     So yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
     I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
     And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible?
