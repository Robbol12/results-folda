Thank you.
    The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
    What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”</span>

<span class="r4">Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">Yes, I can take that.</span>
    I think two points on this question.
    The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company.
    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.

    So just to do a Q3 recap.
    Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
    We had our industry-leading operating margin reach <span class="r2">17</span>%.
    And our free cash flow surpassed $<span class="r2">3</span> billion in Q3 and approached $<span class="r2">9</span> billion in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months.
    As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> cars made in a week with very good quality </span>
<span class="r4">and is ramping rapidly.</span>
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    Our production of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell.
    And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant 
portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.

    And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
    What is the initial Phase <span class="r2">1</span> production target?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”</span>

<span class="r4">Unidentified Company Representative</span>

<span class="r4">I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.</span>
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span class="r7">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.

    And is -- do you anticipate <span class="r2">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
    And how do you balance the need for <span class="r2">4680</span> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in <span class="r2">2023</span>?
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4">.</span>

    And I mean think we’ll start the initial phases of construction next year.
    But I am still somewhat scarred by <span class="r2">2009</span> when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt.
    While that’s now <span class="r2">14</span> years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just 
hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in <span class="r2">2008</span> at <span class="r2">6</span> p.m. 
December 24th, Christmas Eve.
    And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.
    So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and 
then barely made it through <span class="r2">2009</span>.
    So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty.
    A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Unidentified Company Representative</span>

<span class="r4">Like in Giga Texas.</span>
    You said we still have room in this building.
    It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line.
    There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.
    Elon Musk

We also have <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> acres here.
    Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also…

Elon Musk

We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have.
    We could technically do all the scaling, research just here.
    So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area 
only has <span class="r2">2</span> million people.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.
    But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi 
Aramco.
    And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.
    I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.
    So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
    I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, 
some of which you haven’t.
    We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi </span>
<span class="r4">platform design.</span>
    And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours a 
year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> refining, we’re 
moving at top speed to do that.
    So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
    <span class="r10">None</span> of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
    So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla 
team.
    You guys rock.
    You’re the ones making it happen.
    Thank you.

    It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.
    But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without 
you touching wheel.
    So, it’s looking very good.
    Colin Langan

And it would mean like Level <span class="r2">4</span>, Level <span class="r2">5</span> kind of traditional definition you’re talking about?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s - this debate is like what’s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per
mile.
    Like we’re not saying that that’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel.
    It’s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here.</span>
    And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need 
before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it.
    And that’s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need.
    But I think we’ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you’re going to have no one in the car by the end of 
this year.
    And certainly, without a question, that’s whatever in my mind next year.
    I think we’ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the 
average human.
    Colin Langan

Got it.
    And just as a follow-up.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of 
the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.
    So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of <span class="r2">5</span>, which only means that you’re -- 
it’s being used for maybe <span class="r2">50</span> hours a week out of <span class="r2">168</span>, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes
less than <span class="r2">1</span>/<span class="r2">3</span> of the hours of the week is doing something useful.
    You’ve increased the value of that by <span class="r2">5</span>, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a 
hardware company with software margins.
    Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
    Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.
    It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.
    Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle 
cost?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?</span>
    And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
    So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.
    So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
    So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
    It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.
    And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping 
up pretty well, right?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This quarter we convert to building a <span class="r2">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span class="r2">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span class="r2">2</span> of the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span class="r2">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.

    The next question from institutional investors.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the</span>
<span class="r4">opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?</span>
    A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser 
focus on efficiency improvement.
    As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production 
volume.
    For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of 
the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.
    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
    But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico 
factory.
    I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in.

    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
    On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars made in a week with very good quality 
and is ramping rapidly.
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    Our production of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant </span>
<span class="r4">portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.</span>
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span class="r2">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span class="r9">(</span>ph<span class="r9">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.

aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r2">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r4">a </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?

while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
    And that sort of mix is going to shift as <span class="r2">4680</span> scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
    Elon Musk

Right.
    Basically, production of <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp is growing exponentially.

    Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is <span class="r2">300</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>
to <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours or <span class="r2">300</span> to <span class="r2">400</span> terawatt hours.

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high 
tonnage and then some nickel.
    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.

    Do you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while 
also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
    Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well 
positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.

<span class="r4">Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly </span>
<span class="r4">possible to get to </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.</span>

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially 
outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- 
simply from a property market mostly.
    And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
    The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more
than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
    Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
    But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle 
production, sales deliveries by -- on average <span class="r2">50</span>% a year as far into the future as we can see.
