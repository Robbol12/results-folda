--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #19]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On the **production** ramp, ****Giga** **Berlin**** achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
2. [Sentence #20]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) **Giga** Austin or ****Giga** **Texas**** should reach this milestone very soon.

5. [Sentence #114]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of **production** in the U.S. vertically integrated.
6. [Sentence #132]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue **production** at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
7. [Sentence #155]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) And will there be any delays in ramp-up in **production** from ****Giga** **Berlin**** because of this?”

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can take that.
8. [Sentence #167]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

9. [Sentence #218]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized **production** in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
10. [Sentence #331]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) So, like when I came to ****Giga** **Texas**** from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here.

12. [Sentence #656]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in **Berlin** and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
13. [Sentence #819]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of **production** ramping at **Berlin** and Austin?
14. [Sentence #1005]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Unidentified Company Representative

Like in ****Giga** **Texas****.
