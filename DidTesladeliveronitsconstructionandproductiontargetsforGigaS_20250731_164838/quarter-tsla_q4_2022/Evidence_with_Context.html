    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Like just to emphasize on that, we&#x27;ve started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA,</span>
<span class="r5">general assembly, body shops.</span>
    We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
    How many are needed on each continent?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">35</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop </span>
<span class="r5">commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.</span>
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells reached <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells by another <span class="r2">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">72</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a 
volatile year.
    On a full year basis: revenue increased over <span class="r2">50</span>%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over <span class="r2">50</span>%, and 
our margins remained industry-leading.
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span class="r2">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span class="r2">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell </span>
<span class="r5">production factories.</span>
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span class="r2">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">273</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to two million vehicles, but we were saying <span class="r2">1.8</span> 
million, because -- I don&#x27;t know, it just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on earth.
    And we don&#x27;t control if there&#x27;s like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera.
    So, if it&#x27;s a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have
the potential to do <span class="r2">2</span> million cars this year.
    We&#x27;re not committing to that, but I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s the potential.
    So – and I think there would be demand for that, too.
    Rod Lache

Yeah.
    Thanks for clarifying that.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> ramp,</span>
<span class="r5">the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate.</span>
    Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you&#x27;re absorbing from those things like you did last 
quarter?
    And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs 
are headed from this announcement that you just made last night?
    If I&#x27;m correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I&#x27;ve seen anywhere 
else, maybe $<span class="r2">30</span> a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we want to say the specific number, but it&#x27;s interesting, if you look at the size of the – of Giga Nevada 
that is allocated to make <span class="r2">100</span> gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about <span class="r2">35</span>.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, the goals we&#x27;ve outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I 
mean, that&#x27;s been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">313</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Pierre Ferragu

Excellent.
    Zach, actually, I&#x27;d like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost.
    If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $<span class="r2">36</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> in the middle of <span class="r2">2021</span>.
    And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas.
    And this quarter, I think we are close to $<span class="r2">40</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and we peaked maybe close to $<span class="r2">42</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> at some point last year.
    And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $<span class="r2">36</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, which 
would mean Berlin and Texas and those input costs, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like
a kind of like a <span class="r2">10</span>% decline in the COGS per car?
    Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of </span>
<span class="r5">the year, and that&#x27;s within Tesla&#x27;s control.</span>
    We&#x27;re doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that.
    And we talked about supply chain costs, expedite, logistics, attacking everything.
    On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of
cost increase for us, we&#x27;ll have to see where lithium prices go.
    And we&#x27;re not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, is what we&#x27;ve seen from our forecast here, 
cost per car of lithium in <span class="r2">2023</span> will be higher than <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    So that&#x27;s a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels.
    So, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get there this year, but I think we&#x27;ll make progress.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don&#x27;t have control over.

    What are the current roadblocks?
    And when do you expect to scale to <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles a year -- a week?
    Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span class="r2">4680</span> team for achieving <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of </span>
<span class="r5">commissioning and install.</span>
    Really, our <span class="r2">2023</span> goal as a <span class="r2">4680</span> team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span class="r2">4680</span> year in
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> cars to Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>?

    It&#x27;s not something we -- I think we&#x27;ll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we&#x27;re 
thinking about very carefully.
    I really kind of like what is the fastest path to <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>-gigawatt-hours a year of production.
    And you&#x27;ll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.

    Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production </span>
<span class="r5">credits for battery cells packs?</span>
    So $<span class="r2">3</span>,<span class="r2">700</span> per long-range Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $<span class="r2">45</span> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much 
does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.

<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">41</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest

    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
    So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
    And we&#x27;ve got an amazing plan for making the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell low-cost and high energy density.
    So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
