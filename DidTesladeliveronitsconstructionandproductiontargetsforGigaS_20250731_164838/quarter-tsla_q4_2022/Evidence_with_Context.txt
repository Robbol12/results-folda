[TSLA_Q4_2022] Did Tesla deliver on its construction and production targets for Giga Shanghai, Giga Berlin, and Giga Texas between 2022 and 2023?

1. [Sentence #239] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
     But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
     It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
     So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production.
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
>>> Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
     How many are needed on each continent?

2. [Sentence #35] [PILOT]
     So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
     So, basically, price really matters.
     I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it.
     And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
     It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is.
     And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so.
     And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
>>> We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah.
     With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
     This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
     And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
     And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
     Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.

3. [Sentence #72] [UNCERTAIN]
     I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.
     On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
     Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further.
     For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
     Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.
     Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
     First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
>>> Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories.
     Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.
     Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years.
     These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
     The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage.
     While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
     As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
     There are three key points I wanted to make here.
-----
4. [Sentence #273] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to two million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million, because -- I don't know, it just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on earth.
     And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera.
     So, if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year.
     We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential.
     So – and I think there would be demand for that, too.
     Rod Lache

Yeah.
     Thanks for clarifying that.
>>> And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate.
     Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter?
     And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night?
     If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the – of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
-----
5. [Sentence #313] [UNCERTAIN]
     Pierre Ferragu

Excellent.
     Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost.
     If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021.
     And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas.
     And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year.
     And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas and those input costs, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car?
     Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?
>>> Zachary Kirkhorn

The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control.
     We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that.
     And we talked about supply chain costs, expedite, logistics, attacking everything.
     On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go.
     And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, is what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022.
     So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels.
     So, I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress.
     And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over.

6. [Sentence #173] [PLAN]
     What are the current roadblocks?
     And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
     Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
     It was no small feat.
     Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
>>> As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
     Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
-----
7. [Sentence #245] [UNCERTAIN]
     That's great Elon.
     Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
     How many are needed on each continent?
     Elon Musk

It's a good question.
     It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully.
     I really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000-gigawatt-hours a year of production.
     And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Okay.
-----
8. [Sentence #106] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.

9. [Sentence #41] [PILOT]
     And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
     We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah.
     With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
     This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
     And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
     And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
>>> Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
     So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
     Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
     So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
     And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low-cost and high energy density.
     So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
     That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time.
