Thank you.
    The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
    What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”</span>

<span class="r4">Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">Yes, I can take that.</span>
    I think two points on this question.
    The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company.
    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.

    So just to do a Q3 recap.
    Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
    We had our industry-leading operating margin reach <span class="r2">17</span>%.
    And our free cash flow surpassed $<span class="r2">3</span> billion in Q3 and approached $<span class="r2">9</span> billion in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months.
    As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> cars made in a week with very good quality </span>
<span class="r4">and is ramping rapidly.</span>
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    Our production of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell.
    And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant 
portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.

    And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
    What is the initial Phase <span class="r2">1</span> production target?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”</span>

<span class="r4">Unidentified Company Representative</span>

<span class="r4">I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.</span>
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span class="r7">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.

    And is -- do you anticipate <span class="r2">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
    And how do you balance the need for <span class="r2">4680</span> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in <span class="r2">2023</span>?
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is <span class="r2">4680</span> Model Y?

Yes.

    It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.
    But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi 
Aramco.
    And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.
    I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.
    So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
    I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, 
some of which you haven’t.
    We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi </span>
<span class="r4">platform design.</span>
    And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours a 
year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> refining, we’re 
moving at top speed to do that.
    So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
    <span class="r10">None</span> of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
    So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla 
team.
    You guys rock.
    You’re the ones making it happen.

    It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.
    But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without 
you touching wheel.
    So, it’s looking very good.
    Colin Langan

And it would mean like Level <span class="r2">4</span>, Level <span class="r2">5</span> kind of traditional definition you’re talking about?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s - this debate is like what’s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per
mile.
    Like we’re not saying that that’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel.
    It’s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here.</span>
    And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need 
before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it.
    And that’s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need.
    But I think we’ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you’re going to have no one in the car by the end of 
this year.
    And certainly, without a question, that’s whatever in my mind next year.
    I think we’ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the 
average human.

    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our

    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span class="r2">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span class="r9">(</span>ph<span class="r9">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r2">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r4">a </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
    And that sort of mix is going to shift as <span class="r2">4680</span> scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.

Right.
    Basically, production of <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp is growing exponentially.

We need to get <span class="r2">300</span> to <span class="r2">400</span> terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is <span class="r2">300</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>
to <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours or <span class="r2">300</span> to <span class="r2">400</span> terawatt hours.
    Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high 
tonnage and then some nickel.
    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
