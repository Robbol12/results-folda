Texas between <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2023</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">54</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span class="r2">2022</span> versus ‘<span class="r2">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span class="r2">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.</span>
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.

<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">113</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
    So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over <span class="r2">1.5</span> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is</span>
<span class="r4">why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete </span>
<span class="r4">and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of </span><span class="r4">9</span>
<span class="r4">to </span><span class="r4">12</span><span class="r4"> months from start of production.</span>
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.

    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    So first question I had was the extent to which other plants outside of China are insulated from any further 
upstream supply bottlenecks that we may have in China.
    Obviously, if this COVID lockdown things gets out of hand, clearly, that’s going to continue impacting Shanghai.
    But is there a point at which it could actually also impact other facilities?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide.
    And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so </span>
<span class="r4">are our suppliers.</span>
    So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
    Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple
of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of <span class="r6">&quot;real&quot;</span> improvement.
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.

    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
    What is the time line for localizing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.</span>
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai

    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell production at Fremont and </span>
<span class="r4">at Giga Texas?</span>
    What do you expect run rates of <span class="r2">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span class="r2">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
    But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with <span class="r2">4680</span> sometime perhaps towards the end of
the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter.
    Is that accurate?

    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
    First is regarding the Cybertruck.
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
    We still have cells in <span class="r9">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r9">]</span>

Elon Musk

Mention count.
    Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any 
other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.

    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.

<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">430</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I check that once in a while.
    But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count.
    I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">30</span>% less.
    Elon Musk

All right.

Okay.
    Elon Musk

Do we expect to expand?
    Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest </span>
<span class="r4">increase in output will be from Giga Texas.</span>
