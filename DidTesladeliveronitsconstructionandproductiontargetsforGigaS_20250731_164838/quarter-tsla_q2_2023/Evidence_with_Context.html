Texas between <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2023</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">156</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another – a bunch of other companies to put in 
place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.
    We’re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great.
    Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless.
    So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it’s about the same size and magnitude as
the IRA benefits that we also received.
    Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there’s two things to 
keep in mind there.
    The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2.
    So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it’s important to adjust for that.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that </span>
<span class="r5">from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere.</span>
    And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased.
    And so, that’s something to consider as you model out the impact on – from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.
    I do want to ask Karn if there’s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yes.
    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.

    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> </span>
<span class="r5">production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost</span>
<span class="r5">reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.</span>

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
    Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, </span>
<span class="r5">the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour </span>
<span class="r5">today, actually.</span>
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span class="r2">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r2">20</span> years of 
recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
    On the residential side, we have some fun things happening.
    We recently surpassed <span class="r2">0.5</span> million Powerwalls installed.

    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production increased <span class="r2">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span class="r2">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.

    The first question on licensing FSD we’ve already answered.
    So, let’s go to the second one.
    The second question is, what is the status of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?
    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
