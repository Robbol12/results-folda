    Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline 
improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span>?
    Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
    I don&#x27;t want to blow your minds, but I&#x27;m often optimistic regarding time.
    But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    So sometime in the second half.
    That&#x27;s just what our current schedule says.
    But there&#x27;s a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the </span>
<span class="r4">engineers to be living on the line.</span>
    This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
    And it&#x27;s just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it&#x27;s in Austin versus elsewhere.
    So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
    That will be a challenging production ramp.
    Like, as I can emphasize we&#x27;ll be sleeping on the line practically.
    In fact, not practically.
    We will be.

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won&#x27;t be growing at the same rate as before.
    We are between two major growth waves.
    The first one began with the global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with 
the next generation platform.
    In <span class="r2">2024</span>, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of 
the next generation vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is from Michael.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of </span>
<span class="r4">these to produce their first products such as </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span class="r2">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span class="r2">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span class="r2">3</span>.

    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So a much easier situation.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly </span>
<span class="r4">improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.</span>
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
    Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.

    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.
    That&#x27;s our best product ever.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
    And just a brief update from the business perspective.
    Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through <span class="r6">&#x27;24 and &#x27;</span><span class="r2">25</span>.
    We want to thank all of our partners who&#x27;ve put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical 
infrastructure around the world.
    And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong <span class="r2">2023</span> execution.
    Lathrop continues to ramp through <span class="r2">2024</span> with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from <span class="r2">20</span>
gigawatt to <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours by the end of the year.

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">64</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[NO EVIDENCE]</span>
    And we&#x27;re very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
    Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be 
manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then </span>
<span class="r4">we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.</span>
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
    In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite 
of a very high interest rate environment.
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span class="r2">2024</span> and years to come.
    Thank you.
