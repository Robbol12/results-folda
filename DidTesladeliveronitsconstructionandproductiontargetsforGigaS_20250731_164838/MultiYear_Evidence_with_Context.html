Giga Texas between <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2023</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">54</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span class="r2">2022</span> versus ‘<span class="r2">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span class="r2">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.</span>
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.

    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
    So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over <span class="r2">1.5</span> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is</span>
<span class="r4">why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete </span>
<span class="r4">and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of </span><span class="r4">9</span>
<span class="r4">to </span><span class="r4">12</span><span class="r4"> months from start of production.</span>
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.

    On the <span class="r2">800</span>-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
    For the smaller platform vehicles like <span class="r2">3</span> and Y, there’s some wins and losses with <span class="r2">800</span> volts, not everything is 
better.
    And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but 
there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
    It’s really about mass and power.
    And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
    Basically, our estimate is that going from <span class="r2">400</span> to <span class="r2">800</span> volts might save $<span class="r2">100</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not really moving the needle.</span>
    Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
    It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $<span class="r2">100</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got <span class="r2">110</span>-volt household power -- or voltage.
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span class="r2">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.

    Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the Company.
    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
    Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin 
and bottom line profitability.
    GAAP automotive gross margin reached <span class="r2">32.9</span>% and first time exceeded <span class="r2">30</span>% when excluding regulatory credits.
    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.</span>
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span class="r2">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.

    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    So first question I had was the extent to which other plants outside of China are insulated from any further 
upstream supply bottlenecks that we may have in China.
    Obviously, if this COVID lockdown things gets out of hand, clearly, that’s going to continue impacting Shanghai.
    But is there a point at which it could actually also impact other facilities?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide.
    And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so </span>
<span class="r4">are our suppliers.</span>
    So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
    Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple
of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of <span class="r7">&quot;real&quot;</span> improvement.
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.

    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
    What is the time line for localizing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.</span>
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.

    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span class="r2">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span class="r2">2024</span>.

<span class="r4">at Giga Texas?</span>
    What do you expect run rates of <span class="r2">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span class="r2">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
    But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with <span class="r2">4680</span> sometime perhaps towards the end of

But we also had a structural casting, about <span class="r2">30</span>% less robots, we expect to almost double the capacity for body, for 
example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our capacity in a lot of areas.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Right.
    The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack and front and rear castings, the body 
shop size drops by over <span class="r2">60</span>% relative to the standard way of making a car.

<span class="r9">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r9">]</span> general assembly or everything else because, we have the structural battery, the floor is the

    It’s high pressure die cast aluminum.
    And so, we can take both, scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out and put that -- just really 
pass that back into the melting -- aluminum melting pot.
    And then, as Elon was saying, also take any stampings and any other aluminum scrap and also through that in the 
melting pot, matter of fact, we’ve also figured out that we can use wheels from practically any car.
    Yes, yes.
    So, we’re going to be recycling the casting aluminum wheels from legacy gasoline cars as well and throwing that in 
the melting pot for our aluminum cast body of Model Y.
    And also we’ll be moving to the sort of cast part rear body in all vehicles over time?

Thank you.
    At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai?
    Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?
    Elon Musk

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.
    And we’ve now gone through the -- we have basically veteran teams that obviously in the <span class="r2">3</span>/Y ramp -- Y ramp 
especially in multiple locations.
    And we’re obviously sharing what we’ve learned.
    And so, we don’t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, 
and we have done a lot to simplify the production prices of Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas 
and Berlin.

    So, that’s why we have the price increases today because the car ordered today will arrive, in some cases, a year 
from now.
    So, we have a very long wait list, and we’re obviously not demand-limited.
    We are production-limited by -- very much production-limited.

    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span class="r2">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
    Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an <span class="r2">800</span>-volt architecture probably, but it 
really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from <span class="r2">400</span> to <span class="r2">800</span> volts.
    And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
    Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that <span class="r2">100</span> volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
    Elon Musk

$<span class="r2">100</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span class="r4">Sorry.</span>
    $<span class="r2">100</span>.
    It’s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe
it’s been whittled away to $<span class="r2">50</span> or less.
    On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to
the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more 
semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage.
    And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck.
    But for the <span class="r2">3</span>/Y platform where we’ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It’s basically zero for robotaxi.

    It looks like really you think of like just macro tonnage.
    And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we want to -- what are limiting 
factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future.
    And whatever the most limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors.
    So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is 
responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the sales.
    It’s I think the single biggest cost growth item right now certainly on a percentage basis.
    Although just for those who don’t totally know this, the actual content of lithium in lithium ion cell is maybe 
around <span class="r2">2</span>% or <span class="r2">3</span>% of the cell, so.
    Andrew Baglino

<span class="r2">5</span> kgs a car.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">Yes, exactly.</span>
    <span class="r2">5</span> kg.
    It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the 
cathode.
    So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
    So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total 
amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.
    And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are 
thinking about these things.
    And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.

    And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So, we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregon earlier this week.
    Maybe one step that I’ll share.
    So, Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurance market.
    But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the State of Texas.
    And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we’ll be the largest insurer of Teslas.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, the customer reception to this has been quite positive.</span>
    And I was reading social media on Monday after we launched in the three new states, a lot of folks who are reporting
their stories of saving quite substantial amounts of money relative to their previous insurance.
    And so, we’re quite encouraged by that.
    And we’re working as quickly as we can to get to <span class="r2">80</span>% of customers having access to a Tesla Insurance product by the 
end of this year in the United States, at which point we’ll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the U.S.
    The other thing I’ll say on insurance is with these three new states, the model is different because we are now the 
underwriter, and we are also now holding the risk.
    And so, with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials.
    With respect to the financials of the program, it’s still very early.
    And so, as the program gets more scale, happy to share more information on that.

    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
    First is regarding the Cybertruck.
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
    We still have cells in <span class="r9">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r9">]</span>

Elon Musk

Mention count.
    Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any 
other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span class="r2">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.</span>
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.

    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span class="r2">1</span> million units in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span class="r2">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span class="r2">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.</span>
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span class="r2">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
    Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car
business, worth more than FSD.
    That’s my firm belief.
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.

    I check that once in a while.
    But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count.
    I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">30</span>% less.
    Elon Musk

All right.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Elon Musk

Do we expect to expand?
    Yes, we do expect to expand Giga Nevada.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest </span>
<span class="r4">increase in output will be from Giga Texas.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
    Alex, can you hear us?
    Alex Potter

Yes.

    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
    What is the time line for localizing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai </span>
<span class="r4">this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.</span>
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
    So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over <span class="r2">1.5</span> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span class="r2">9</span>
to <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide.
    And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere.
    But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so 
are our suppliers.
    So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple</span>
<span class="r4">of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of </span><span class="r4">&quot;real&quot;</span><span class="r4"> improvement.</span>
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.

<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s go to the next question from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.</span>
    Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.
    I’m trying to just parse out your comments about the inflation and constrained supply and battery feedstocks and the
initiatives that you are working on internally to secure these materials.
    It sounds like you’re optimistic about Tesla’s ability to solve this for Tesla.
    Do you -- but do you see this as a constraint on EV adoption more broadly?
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    But what’s sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we have long-term contracts with 
suppliers, but those long-term contracts will obviously run out and then the year we’ll start to see potentially 
significant cost increases.
    But the macro is sort of looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition
to sustainable energy faster?

    Martin Viecha

All right.
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
    What do you expect run rates of <span class="r2">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span class="r2">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> sometime perhaps towards the end of</span>
<span class="r4">the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter.</span>
    Is that accurate?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    And the other thing I would add is like with the China COVID shutdown and the semiconductor bottlenecks we had 
through Q4 and hence a little bit in Q1, we have sizable cell inventory at the moment, and excess cells to support the 
<span class="r2">2022</span> volume targets you described.
    So, that gives us the ability to be pretty deliberate in the <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp where we can maximize learning step by step, 
take engineering downtime to upgrade key pieces of equipment and modify the structural pack design to improve 
reliability, all while achieving what you just said, so.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> output is not a risk to achieving <span class="r2">1.5</span> million vehicles produced this year, but it would become a risk next year
if we do not solve volume production by early <span class="r2">2023</span>, but we’re highly confident of doing so.

    One thing I want to call out is like we’re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re recycling </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4"> tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to </span><span class="r4">150</span><span class="r4"> with all of that reclaimed material going </span>
<span class="r4">directly back into our cathode supply chain.</span>
    So, we’re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
    Elon Musk

And that’s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries.
    But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of 
its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop.
    We regrind any plastic figures out.
    And so, we’re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get 
them in the door, using all <span class="r2">100</span>% of them.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    No, that’s a great point.

    So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re 
going to be waiting forever.
    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r4">All right.</span>
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
    What do you expect run rates of <span class="r2">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?

    For the smaller platform vehicles like <span class="r2">3</span> and Y, there’s some wins and losses with <span class="r2">800</span> volts, not everything is 
better.
    And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but 
there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
    It’s really about mass and power.
    And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
    Basically, our estimate is that going from <span class="r2">400</span> to <span class="r2">800</span> volts might save $<span class="r2">100</span>.
    It’s not really moving the needle.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span class="r4">And you’re changing many things.</span>
    It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $<span class="r2">100</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got <span class="r2">110</span>-volt household power -- or voltage.
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span class="r2">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
    Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an <span class="r2">800</span>-volt architecture probably, but it 
really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from <span class="r2">400</span> to <span class="r2">800</span> volts.

    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the Company.
    Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shuts at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, 
we’ve continued making progress and achieved our best-ever vehicle deliveries.
    Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin 
and bottom line profitability.
    GAAP automotive gross margin reached <span class="r2">32.9</span>% and first time exceeded <span class="r2">30</span>% when excluding regulatory credits.
    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being </span>
<span class="r4">ordered today.</span>
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span class="r2">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
