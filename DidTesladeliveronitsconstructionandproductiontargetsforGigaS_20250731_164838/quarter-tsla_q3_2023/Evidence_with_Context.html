Texas between <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2023</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">448</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And I mean think we’ll start the initial phases of construction next year.
    But I am still somewhat scarred by <span class="r2">2009</span> when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt.
    While that’s now <span class="r2">14</span> years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just 
hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in <span class="r2">2008</span> at <span class="r2">6</span> p.m. 
December 24th, Christmas Eve.
    And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.
    So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and 
then barely made it through <span class="r2">2009</span>.
    So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty.
    A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Unidentified Company Representative</span>

<span class="r5">Like in Giga Texas.</span>
    You said we still have room in this building.
    It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line.
    There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.
    Elon Musk

We also have <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> acres here.
    Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also…

Elon Musk

We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have.
    We could technically do all the scaling, research just here.
    So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area 
only has <span class="r2">2</span> million people.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of 
the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy.
    So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of <span class="r2">5</span>, which only means that you’re -- 
it’s being used for maybe <span class="r2">50</span> hours a week out of <span class="r2">168</span>, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes
less than <span class="r2">1</span>/<span class="r2">3</span> of the hours of the week is doing something useful.
    You’ve increased the value of that by <span class="r2">5</span>, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a 
hardware company with software margins.
    Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
    Pierre Ferragu

Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay.
    It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter.
    Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle 
cost?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin?</span>
    And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise.
    So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks for the question.
    So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
    So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
    It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.
    And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping 
up pretty well, right?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">99</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    This quarter we convert to building a <span class="r2">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span class="r2">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span class="r2">2</span> of the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span class="r2">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.

Thank you.
    The next question from institutional investors.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the</span>
<span class="r5">opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?</span>
    A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser 
focus on efficiency improvement.
    As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production 
volume.
    For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of 
the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.
    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
    But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico 
factory.
    I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in.
