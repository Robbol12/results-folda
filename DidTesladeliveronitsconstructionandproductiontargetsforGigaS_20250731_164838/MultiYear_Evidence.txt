[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla deliver on its construction and production targets for Giga Shanghai, Giga Berlin, and Giga Texas between 2022 and 2023?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #18]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) So, also making good progress with **production** ramp with **Berlin**.
2. [Sentence #19]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On the **production** ramp, ****Giga** **Berlin**** achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
3. [Sentence #20]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) **Giga** Austin or ****Giga** **Texas**** should reach this milestone very soon.
4. [Sentence #20]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) And we are expecting – sorry, our ****Giga** **Texas**** to exceed the 1,000 vehicle per week milestone, hopefully in the next few months.
5. [Sentence #25]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume **production** line at ****Giga** **Texas****, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
6. [Sentence #54]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Obviously, we ramped **production**, as you will know, with ****Giga** **Berlin**** and ****Giga** **Texas**** in the past few months.
7. [Sentence #59]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the ****Giga** **Texas**** opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
8. [Sentence #70]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) We’re building a Cybertruck line here at ****Giga** **Texas**** [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.
9. [Sentence #72]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) The **Shanghai** factory resumed full **production** and our new factories in Austin and **Berlin** are progressing well through their initial ramps.
10. [Sentence #106]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) But Tesla **Shanghai** -- ****Giga** **Shanghai**** is coming back with a vengeance.
11. [Sentence #107]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from ****Giga** **Shanghai**** this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
12. [Sentence #113]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is why ****Giga** **Berlin**** and ****Giga** **Texas**** are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start of **production**.
13. [Sentence #120]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at ****Giga** **Texas**** was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line.
14. [Sentence #155]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) And will there be any delays in ramp-up in **production** from ****Giga** **Berlin**** because of this?”

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can take that.
15. [Sentence #156]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and **Berlin** cost, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y **production** costs elsewhere.
16. [Sentence #167]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in ****Giga** **Texas**** for Cybertruck.
17. [Sentence #214]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) When will Tesla start **construction** on the **Giga** Nevada expansion and **Giga** Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
18. [Sentence #223]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y **production** line in **Shanghai** and **Berlin**.
19. [Sentence #239]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of **production** equipment here in ****Giga** **Texas****, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
20. [Sentence #254]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) And is ****Giga** **Texas**** producing cells yet?
21. [Sentence #262]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of **production** ramping at **Berlin** and Austin?
22. [Sentence #263]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of 4680 cell **production** at Fremont and at ****Giga** **Texas****?
23. [Sentence #264]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) What do you expect run rates of 4680 to be in Fremont and the ****Giga** **Texas**** or **Berlin** at the end of the year?
24. [Sentence #269]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) So the following question is with regards to the ramp of **production** in Austin and **Berlin**.
25. [Sentence #331]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) So, like when I came to ****Giga** **Texas**** from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here.
26. [Sentence #410]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Will we have any **production** of vehicles in that factory, or all the future **production** will happen in **Giga** Austin?
27. [Sentence #430]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) There’s a lot of room for expansion there, and we do expect to increase output from Nevada, but by far, the biggest increase in output will be from ****Giga** **Texas****.
28. [Sentence #444]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) But all indications are that we are -- our ****Giga** **Shanghai**** is back in **production** at fairly high levels already and so are our suppliers.
29. [Sentence #448]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Unidentified Company Representative

Like in ****Giga** **Texas****.
30. [Sentence #515]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Some of the Model Ys coming out of ****Giga** **Texas**** are 4680.
