between <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2023</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">54</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span class="r2">2022</span> versus ‘<span class="r2">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span class="r2">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.</span>
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
    So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over <span class="r2">1.5</span> million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is</span>
<span class="r4">why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete </span>
<span class="r4">and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of </span><span class="r4">9</span>
<span class="r4">to </span><span class="r4">12</span><span class="r4"> months from start of production.</span>
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
    But to get to sort of the <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week level has typically taken us around <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods 
sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
    Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
    Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about 
increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our 
vehicles is quite long.
    And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year.

    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    So first question I had was the extent to which other plants outside of China are insulated from any further 
upstream supply bottlenecks that we may have in China.
    Obviously, if this COVID lockdown things gets out of hand, clearly, that’s going to continue impacting Shanghai.
    But is there a point at which it could actually also impact other facilities?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide.
    And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so </span>
<span class="r4">are our suppliers.</span>
    So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
    Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple
of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of <span class="r6">&quot;real&quot;</span> improvement.
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.

    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
    What is the time line for localizing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.</span>
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.

    And then, Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span class="r2">9</span>

    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re </span>
<span class="r4">anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.</span>
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.

    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
    So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are 
aiming for volume production in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell production at Fremont and </span>
<span class="r4">at Giga Texas?</span>
    What do you expect run rates of <span class="r2">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span class="r2">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span class="r2">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
    But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with <span class="r2">4680</span> sometime perhaps towards the end of
the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter.
    Is that accurate?

    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
    First is regarding the Cybertruck.
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
    We still have cells in <span class="r8">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r8">]</span>

Elon Musk

Mention count.
    Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any 
other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.

    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.

    I check that once in a while.
    But in general, architecture is always moving to reduce complexity, reduce parts or reduce parts count.
    I would say, ignoring the battery cells, we are probably <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">30</span>% less.

Do we expect to expand?

<span class="r4">increase in output will be from Giga Texas.</span>

    It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is
why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete 
and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of <span class="r2">9</span>
to <span class="r2">12</span> months from start of production.
    So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.

    And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are 
thinking about these things.
    And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    One thing I want to call out is like we’re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories.
    We’re recycling <span class="r2">50</span> tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to <span class="r2">150</span> with all of that reclaimed material going 
directly back into our cathode supply chain.
    So, we’re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
    Elon Musk

And that’s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of </span>
<span class="r4">its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop.</span>
    We regrind any plastic figures out.
    And so, we’re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get 
them in the door, using all <span class="r2">100</span>% of them.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    No, that’s a great point.
    So, we’re storing -- we’re installing sort of furnaces  for probably for aluminum like sort for the Model Y that 
we’ve built here in Giga Texas has both a front and a rear body casting.
    So, we’re casting almost two-thirds of the body.
    It’s high pressure die cast aluminum.

    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span class="r2">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span class="r2">19</span>%.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in </span>
<span class="r4">early April.</span>
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.

    But -- if things go according to plan, we will be in volume production with <span class="r2">4680</span> sometime perhaps towards the end of
the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter.
    Is that accurate?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    And the other thing I would add is like with the China COVID shutdown and the semiconductor bottlenecks we had 
through Q4 and hence a little bit in Q1, we have sizable cell inventory at the moment, and excess cells to support the 
<span class="r2">2022</span> volume targets you described.
    So, that gives us the ability to be pretty deliberate in the <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp where we can maximize learning step by step, 
take engineering downtime to upgrade key pieces of equipment and modify the structural pack design to improve 
reliability, all while achieving what you just said, so.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> output is not a risk to achieving <span class="r2">1.5</span> million vehicles produced this year, but it would become a risk next year
if we do not solve volume production by early <span class="r2">2023</span>, but we’re highly confident of doing so.

Thank you.
    At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai?
    Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?
    Elon Musk

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.
    And we’ve now gone through the -- we have basically veteran teams that obviously in the <span class="r2">3</span>/Y ramp -- Y ramp 
especially in multiple locations.
    And we’re obviously sharing what we’ve learned.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we don’t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, </span>
<span class="r4">and we have done a lot to simplify the production prices of Model Y that should lead us to a faster ramp within Texas </span>
<span class="r4">and Berlin.</span>
    Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

But we also had a structural casting, about <span class="r2">30</span>% less robots, we expect to almost double the capacity for body, for 
example, reducing the number of robots, but doubling our capacity in a lot of areas.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Right.
    The body line for the structural pack is -- and if you got a structural pack and front and rear castings, the body 
shop size drops by over <span class="r2">60</span>% relative to the standard way of making a car.
    Andrew Baglino

<span class="r8">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r8">]</span> general assembly or everything else because, we have the structural battery, the floor is the 
battery.
    We put the seats on the battery and then we put that in the cars.

    And so, we can take both, scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out and put that -- just really 
pass that back into the melting -- aluminum melting pot.
    And then, as Elon was saying, also take any stampings and any other aluminum scrap and also through that in the 
melting pot, matter of fact, we’ve also figured out that we can use wheels from practically any car.
    Yes, yes.
    So, we’re going to be recycling the casting aluminum wheels from legacy gasoline cars as well and throwing that in 
the melting pot for our aluminum cast body of Model Y.
    And also we’ll be moving to the sort of cast part rear body in all vehicles over time?

    The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 
<span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
    And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?</span>
    What is the time line for localizing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.

cars for some reason.
    But in the absence of that, we will continue to grow output at a rapid clip.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    Thank you.
    And then just on the margins associated with Austin and Berlin.
    You mentioned Austin want to have the margin drag until you reach intended volumes.
    I don&#x27;t know if you can disclose what those volumes are.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then maybe you could just remind us of what the margin profile of Austin and Berlin will look like versus </span>
<span class="r4">Shanghai once you get the vertical integration benefits in place?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, probably one have be quite as good as Shanghai.
    Shanhai is hard to -- has a very efficient cost structures, obviously, our lowest cost structure in the world.
    But we do expect to be -- make significant improvements in Austin and Berlin and continue to make improvements in 
Fremont as well.
    So<span class="r10">...</span>

Roshan Thomas

For making improvements in North America &amp; Berlin cost structures, we&#x27;ve increased -- this is Roshan by the way.
    We increased our localization efforts strategically.
    So that will then drive down our days on-hand requirements reducing tied up working capital.
    We&#x27;ve made <span class="r2">10</span>% quarter-over-quarter improvement in days on-hand.

    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.</span>
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r2">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving 
beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.

    So we&#x27;re not out to destroy competitors or anything like that.
    We&#x27;re trying to help competitors, frankly, in any way we can.

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to Dan Levy from Barclays.
    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; First question, you&#x27;re ramping supply at Austin and Berlin.</span>
    So I wanted to understand just how critical it is to further increase volume at those plants just to get the 
vertical integration benefits in the face of the market with some demand questions.
    And just broadly, should we -- I mean, historically, you&#x27;ve been operating at the pace at which your supply allows 
you to produce as opposed to gauging to demand.
    Should we generally expect that you&#x27;re going to continue to produce at your -- whatever the max capacity that you&#x27;re
allowed within your supply constraints, regardless of what the broader economic environment is just to continue to get 
that volume out there?
    Elon Musk

So that is -- yes, I mean, there could be like obviously a macro shock that is so severe that people just stop buying 
cars for some reason.
    But in the absence of that, we will continue to grow output at a rapid clip.
