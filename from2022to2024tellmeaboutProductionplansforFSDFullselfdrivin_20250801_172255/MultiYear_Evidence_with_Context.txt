[Multi-Year Analysis] from 2022 to 2024 tell me about Production plans for FSD Fullselfdriving

1. [Sentence #452, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     If it would continue, but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide.
     And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere.
     But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so are our suppliers.
     So, we don’t think this is going to be a big deal.
     Alex Potter

Okay.
     Thanks.
     Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of "real" improvement.
     Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
     And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Musk

There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
     Colin Langan

Great.
     Do you guys hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Colin Langan

Perfect.
     Just to follow-up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, but obviously, it seems pretty important.
     How quickly can raw material supply be built?
     Because my understanding is it takes many years to build that out.
     So, are we just sort of facing -- when do you think we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage?
     And is there even enough time to build that sort of mining capacity in place?

2. [Sentence #316, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There’s a saying in the military, it’s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it comes to war.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about previously on raw materials, commodities.
     Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring those costs down.
     Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of Model 3 way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market.
     And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
     Prices are higher for all other automakers.
     We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price of the vehicles.
     And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.
     So, it’s one of the points.
     But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the progression of prices over time?
>>> Elon Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.
     It’s been very difficult with the -- I mean, I think, inflation is at like a 40 or 50-year high.
     And I think the official numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation, so.
     And that inflation appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year is what -- when we’re talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severe cost pressure.
     So, yes, and in some cases, we’re seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increases for parts from last year to the end of this year.
     So, it’s -- there’s a lot of cost pressure there.
     That’s why we raised our prices because we -- when things are on -- with respect to inflation, you know it’s high, then -- and we’ve got orders that go out a year or more in some cases, then we have to anticipate those cost increases.
     But I think, especially with the robotaxi and autonomy, I think we will end up providing consumers with, by far, the lowest cost per mile of transport that they’ve ever experienced.
     Yes.
     I mean with robotaxi, like maybe 5 to 10 times cost per mile.
     It’s really quite substantial.
     Andrew Baglino

And therefore, accessible to everybody.

     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a robotaxi ride will cost less than a bus ticket, a subsidized bus ticket or subsidized subway ticket.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

4. [Sentence #77, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
     And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.
     And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program.
     The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
     Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD.
>>> That’s my firm belief.
     So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
     We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
     So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
     And basically, the future is very exciting.
     I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to first investor question.
     And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
     We love his optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being made?
     Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
