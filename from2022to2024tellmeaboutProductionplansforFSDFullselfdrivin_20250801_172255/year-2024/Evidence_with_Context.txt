[Year 2024] from 2022 to 2024 tell me about Production plans for FSD Fullselfdriving

1. [Sentence #1462, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
     Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we're pulling that.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     Most the time, you don't need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
     The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
     And that's why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people don't realize that it has so much capability.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they're not like obviously super futuristic.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
>>> What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
     So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we're progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory in Reno.
     We've released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production.
     Semi growth will largely depend on our customers' adoption of the product.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don't think we're going to be limited, honestly.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
     We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it's about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it's a no brainer.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     Fundamentally, if you've got a Semi, the fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport is better than a diesel truck.

     Fundamentally, if you've got a Semi, the fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport is better than a diesel truck.
     Any company that doesn't adopt an electric Semi will lose.
     It's not a subjective thing.
     It's like whether do you like just competitive -- we want the stat -- we want to have a good old Semi truck.

3. [Sentence #716, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter.
     These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs.
     We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world.
     This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car.
     We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
     On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
     It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
>>> Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
     Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.
     Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.
     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
     The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.
