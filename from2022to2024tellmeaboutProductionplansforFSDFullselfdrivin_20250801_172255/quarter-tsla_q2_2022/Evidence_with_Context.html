Shanghai and Fremont, as we said last month for record production and they are really fire to better doing really well.
    But then also Berlin are coming on strong.
    Theoretically, they also had record quarters last quarter.
    And if we ramp them to the capacity shown in the deck by the end of this year, we will be at that rate.
    Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO , and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very
difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
    But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
    And so that’s why I am confident we will get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year

Thank you.
    The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
    Colin, go ahead please.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
    I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the 
caveats associated with that can use it.
    Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
    The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
    It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
    Colin Rusch

Great.
    And then sorry to belabor a little bit on battery materials side.
    But in terms of some of the suppliers and the contaminants, can you be a little bit more specific around some of the
elements that you guys see in some of your supply chain that can prove troublesome yields for the 4680s, particularly 
around lithium and potential contaminants in either hydroxide, the carbonates that you guys end up seeing real issues 
with as you move into production?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I don’t really think we have anything to comment on, yes, the purity specs of lithium on this call right now, yes.
