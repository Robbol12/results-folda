[Year Q4] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching ****Model** 3** last quarter and achieving the first **deliveries** earlier this year.
2. [Sentence #51]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating ****Model** 3** orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
3. [Sentence #53]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of ****Model** 3** in Fremont and Reno.
4. [Sentence #55]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This is evidenced by the launch of ****Model** 3** in Shanghai, as well as **Model** Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
5. [Sentence #63]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) On **Model** Y, we expect first **deliveries** in limited quantities later this quarter and will **ramp** over subsequent quarters.
6. [Sentence #65]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This year for the Shanghai built ****Model** 3**, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
7. [Sentence #68]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built ****Model** 3** and remain focused on continuing the production **ramp** and managing costs.
8. [Sentence #74]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products ****Model** 3** in Shanghai and **Model** Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
9. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the **ramp** of Shanghai built ****Model** 3** due to a government required factory shutdown.
10. [Sentence #77]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from ****Model** 3** Shanghai remains in the early stages.
11. [Sentence #87]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in ****North** **America**** on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
12. [Sentence #159]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the ****Model** 3** there.
13. [Sentence #163]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the ****Model** 3** factory in **China** and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
14. [Sentence #164]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of ****Model** 3** in **China** relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
15. [Sentence #168]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in **China**, ****North** **America**** and **Europe**.
16. [Sentence #169]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in **China**, a factory in California, a factory -- ****North** **America**** factory in **Europe**.
17. [Sentence #186]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) I think some of our learnings during the ****Model** 3** launch period where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity.
18. [Sentence #270]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure ****Model** 3** or **Model** Y cars.
19. [Sentence #287]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) I want to talk about the differences between the ****Model** 3** and the **Model** Y beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb, just around cargo and size.
20. [Sentence #290]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially ****Model** 3** sales will expand alongside the introduction of **Model** Y?
21. [Sentence #303]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, ****Model** 3** is expanding as **Model** Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
22. [Sentence #353]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So I mean, relative to the current ****Model** 3**, **China** **Model** 2 pricing is slightly lower.
23. [Sentence #461]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We ramped the ****Model** 3** in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
24. [Sentence #549]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early **Model** Y **ramp** in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
25. [Sentence #561]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to ****Model** 3** production and building.
26. [Sentence #654]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in ****North** **America****.
27. [Sentence #659]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in ****North** **America****.
28. [Sentence #663]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) In ****North** **America****, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
29. [Sentence #730]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for ****Model** 3**, it's approaching the high 200s.
30. [Sentence #783]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and ****North** **America****.
