    <span class="r5">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r5">]</span> But before we jump into the Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, just to recap the year, <span class="r2">2020</span> was a defining year for us on many levels.
    Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering <span class="r2">0.5</span> million cars.
    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span class="r2">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span class="r2">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
    We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We ramped the Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> in Shanghai to more than </span><span class="r6">5</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow </span>
<span class="r6">rapidly.</span>
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span class="r2">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
    Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we&#x27;re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X
are in production now and will be delivered in February.
    So we&#x27;ve been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
    And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
    The Model S Plaid, and we&#x27;re actually in production now, and we&#x27;ll be delivering next month.
    So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior.
    There are actually a lot of great things about this.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And one more question is from retail investors.
    What is Tesla doing to improve service experience?
    Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service.
    Now it&#x27;s impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.
    Jerome?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    Well, as far as best service, no service.
    So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
    In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
    So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
    And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than </span><span class="r6">40</span><span class="r6">% of all visits in North America.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to push that to <span class="r2">50</span>% this year.
    In <span class="r2">50</span>% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
    So we&#x27;re trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
    And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
    We have about -- we have actually <span class="r2">140</span> service centers right now in North America.
    For <span class="r2">100</span> out of those <span class="r2">140</span>, you can get appointments in less than <span class="r2">10</span> days.
    And we&#x27;re going to make sure it&#x27;s all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
    We&#x27;re accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
    In North America, we opened <span class="r2">11</span> centers in December, and we have plans to open <span class="r2">46</span> in the first half of this year.
    So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing to improve service.
    In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
    Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
    And we are trying to move away from the phone.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">350</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zach, do you want to – I don’t know, Zach and Jerome?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

The – what we&#x27;re seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is pretty dynamic space, but it&#x27;s overall not particularly 
limiting on a rule basis, but what we&#x27;re going to expect is to have to work with regulators to demonstrate really, 
really high reliability, as Elon said before.
    The rest of the world is fairly dynamic.
    In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally not reaching past Level <span class="r2">3</span> right now with some impetus to start 
working on new working groups to reach past that.
    And China showed an interest in working on Level <span class="r2">4</span> or even Level <span class="r2">5</span> later this year.
    So we expect a pretty dynamic <span class="r2">2021</span> in the regulatory space.
    We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high 
reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
    And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
    Obviously, there&#x27;s a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
    Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you&#x27;re migrating some of your exposure around some of your 
raw material costs?
    Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in </span>
<span class="r6">particular, both between Asia and North America.</span>
    But we&#x27;re also looking forward to pricing, and we&#x27;re watching this very closely for all the components.
    We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you&#x27;re going to 
have enough quantity to support the growth, <span class="r2">50</span>% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate 
sharing of the risk.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
    Please go ahead.
    Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
    Thank you.
    Two questions, one on <span class="r2">2021</span> and just one on capital.
    First, on <span class="r2">2021</span>.
    Any expectations for what we should see on regulatory credit sales?
    And then the second question is on capital.
    Obviously, you raised a lot of capital in <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering some of the maturities?
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">128</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will
be a part of this year&#x27;s story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
    Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X 
production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
    Additionally, we&#x27;re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port 
capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
    We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including
OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    Global demand continues to outpace production, and we&#x27;re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
    I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can jump straight into questions from <span class="r5">[</span>Safe<span class="r5">]</span>  Technologies.
    The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share
leader in solar?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    So we&#x27;re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
    And we had our best quarter since, I think, <span class="r2">2018</span> in Q4.
    So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> production </span>
<span class="r6">and building.</span>
    We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
    But now we got a little more bandwidth, we&#x27;re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
    So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows 
us to have industry-leading pricing.
    And so that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the 
place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become
the leader in the space.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar
and Tesla Roof.
    And we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, 
whether it&#x27;s retrofit or but  roof before the end of the year.
    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.
    As Zach mentioned, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we&#x27;re making 
great progress in that regard.
    And I think we&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s really dialed in this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">297</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
    Their attention to detail is incredible.
    So they -- I&#x27;m confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
    And we hopefully that is later this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
    What&#x27;s the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6">, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.</span>
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span class="r2">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span class="r2">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
    So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">226</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Now it&#x27;s impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.

    So we&#x27;re trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
    And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We have about -- we have actually </span><span class="r6">140</span><span class="r6"> service centers right now in North America.</span>
    For <span class="r2">100</span> out of those <span class="r2">140</span>, you can get appointments in less than <span class="r2">10</span> days.

    So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing to improve service.
    In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
    Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
    And we are trying to move away from the phone.
    As the app is much better than the phone.
    It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.
    And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.
    You can have pictures in there.
    You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff.

    Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies.
    Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross 
margin.
    Our services and other P&amp;L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs 
associated with new service capacity.
    However, what&#x27;s most important here is that we&#x27;ve accelerated the growth in service capacity and we’ll continue to 
drive capacity expansion as fast as possible.
    On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease PPA
business.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned, as well as increased 
investment in development of future products.
    Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $<span class="r2">100</span> million of interest expense 
for the quarter.
    All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain 
industry leading.
    As we look forward, <span class="r2">2021</span> may be our most meaningful step forward yet, as we see the benefits of long-standing 
investments in capacity and technology.
    The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches.
    That&#x27;s a few things we should keep in mind.
    We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of <span class="r2">50</span>%, of which we may materially exceed this in <span class="r2">2021</span>.
    As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will
be a part of this year&#x27;s story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.

    Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering <span class="r2">0.5</span> million cars.
    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span class="r2">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span class="r2">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
    We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
    We ramped the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai to more than <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow 
rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.</span>
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span class="r2">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
    Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we&#x27;re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X
are in production now and will be delivered in February.
    So we&#x27;ve been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
    And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
    The Model S Plaid, and we&#x27;re actually in production now, and we&#x27;ll be delivering next month.
    So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior.
    There are actually a lot of great things about this.
    I&#x27;ll do another call about the Model S later.
    But it&#x27;s really a tremendous improvement over the prior version.
    And the Model S will be the first -- this Model S Plaid will be the first production car ever that is able to go <span class="r2">0</span> 
to <span class="r2">60</span> miles an hour in under <span class="r2">2</span> seconds.
    So no production car ever has been able to get below <span class="r2">2</span> seconds <span class="r2">0</span> to <span class="r2">60</span>.
