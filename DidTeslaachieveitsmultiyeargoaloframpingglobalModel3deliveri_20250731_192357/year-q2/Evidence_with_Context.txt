[Year Q2] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #33, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.
     We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
     It's going to be right near Austin.
     It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions.
     But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning.
     It's right on the Colorado River.
     So we're actually going to have a boardwalk where there'll a hiking and biking trail.
     It's going to basically be an ecological paradise.
     Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
     So not closed and only Tesla.
     So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know.
     This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there.
     And it's also where we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
>>> And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.
     Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
     But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America.
     And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
     So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
     And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.
     And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
     The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down the road.
     Let's see, is there anything more I want to say about?
     There's a lot of information.
     So anything, guys?
     All right.
     Well, I'm sure they have lots of questions.
     We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.

3. [Sentence #127, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital.
     A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
     While our AR balance is usually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
     First, overall, less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
     Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
     Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
     Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
     Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce driving down this balance.
     As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
     We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital management.
     This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next 1.5 years.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let's go to questions from institutional investors first.
>>> The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck?
     Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y?
     Or region-specific vehicles?
     Or anything else?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what's announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches.
     But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity [indiscernible] vehicle of some kind.
     These are likely things at some point.
     But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
     So it's a long way to go with those.
     I think we'll do the obvious things.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla?
     What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
     Elon Musk

Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
-----
4. [Sentence #348, TSLA_Q2_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio.
     It didn't make sense up to now to do it.
     But we'll be ready.
     And that's maybe a little biased.
     I'm very excited about this.
     And we have a lot of very unique technology that we're always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi.
     It will be just awesome.
     Yes.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And there’s like two general classes of cell.
     There's like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer range.
     Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo.
     So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
>>> What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume production later this year.
     So, we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
     And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
     So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
     We use very little cobalt in our system already and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y.
     No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
     Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
     What are the biggest constraints now?
     Elon Musk

Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
     Okay.
     Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
     As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.

5. [Sentence #101, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for your support over the last quarter.
     In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with the hard work and the resiliency that you all have shown.
     On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
     This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world.
     To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects.
     The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions.
     Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
     On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
     This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the various shutdowns.
>>> Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
     With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
     The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
     Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
     While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
     Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
     In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
     We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity.
     And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
     Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2.
     This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A within operating expenses.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which included free cash flows of over $400 million.
     This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital.
-----
6. [Sentence #498, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Zach Kirkhorn

Sure.
     I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit.
     We manage the business, said differently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future.
     I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to 2019, and it will continue for some period of time, but eventually, the stream of regulatory credits will reduce.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's worth telling that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.
     Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 pack tax credit.
     And yet our sales have continued to do well.
     Yes.
     Zach Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
     That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
>>> Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.
     You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, particularly full self-driving, there's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will expand as we release more features.
     And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network.
     Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
     There's still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
     So we continue to see efficiencies there.
     So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
     And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
     So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%.
     We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing to be partner [ph].
     Toni Sacconaghi

Thank you.
     And if I could just follow-up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really trying to drive EV adoption globally.
     So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader?
     It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growth and more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price reductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company has made.
-----
7. [Sentence #450, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3?
     And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
     You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
     What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
     And what your Texas factory is going to be?
     Thank you.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.
     We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
     The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
     So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
     Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
     And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
>>> And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
     They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
     And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
     And it's continuing to do more and more internally.
     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
     And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.
     Zach Kirkhorn

There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I will say it like this.
     The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
     Zach Kirkhorn

And so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin and we've awarded a lot of business.

     It will be just awesome.

     Okay.
     Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
     As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
     Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way.
     So, hopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies.
     Please get nickel.
     With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for Range is going to be just in U.S. EPA terms approximately 300 miles.
     So, I think people will really come to expect that as some number close to 300 miles as normal.
     That's a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, like, is it very hot outside or very cold?
-----
10. [Sentence #157, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PILOT]
     So overnight, 1 million -- depending on exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions, you have like at least a few million cars, suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that.
     Certainly five times higher utility.
     They go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that or [indiscernible] to 60, something like that.
     So, everything else is pretty small by comparison.
     Now, when things do become full self-driving, so what are we going to do in the car?
     Well, I guess we're probably going want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind.
     Or maybe play games and do work.
     That's in the future.
     We're already putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, we have been experimenting on that.
     So, FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity in the near-term.
     But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right.
     So, premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put in place.
>>> And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats.
     So, these are things that we have and we're continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can launch and we'll trickle those in with time.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to full self-driving depending upon how you calculate it is probably worth at least $100,000 per car.
     So, it's a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The third question is also about Autopilot.
     What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones?
     And how do you think about timing?
     Elon Musk

Well, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in -- like two and a half feet.
     It's like think -- things like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are [partially] [ph] correlated in time, but not very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D where it's like -- which is video essentially.
     You're thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time.
     So, that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet, is what really matters for full self-driving.
     So, what we've been doing, thus far, is really just things like 2D -- mostly 2D and like I said, not well correlated in time.
