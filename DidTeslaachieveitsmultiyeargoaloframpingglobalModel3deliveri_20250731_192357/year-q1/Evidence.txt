[Year Q1] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in **Europe**, similar to what ****North** **America**** experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to **China**.
2. [Sentence #25]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our ****global** **deliveries**** occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
3. [Sentence #39]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the ****Model** 3** more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a ****Model** 3**.
4. [Sentence #40]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) And keep in mind, **global** expansion for the ****Model** 3** has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the **Model** S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
5. [Sentence #53]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) So, with the recently announced product improvements on **Model** S and X as well as continued expansion of ****Model** 3** globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production levels.
6. [Sentence #62]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) The **global** expansion of ****Model** 3** was a huge theme within the quarter.
7. [Sentence #63]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) We launched the standard range lineup for ****Model** 3** product retooling from **Model** S and **Model** X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
8. [Sentence #69]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding ****Model** 3** operations overseas.
9. [Sentence #75]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) This led to a binary inflow of ****Model** 3** cars to EMEA and **China** and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
10. [Sentence #91]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that **North** American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of ****Model** 3**.
11. [Sentence #98]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to ****Model** 3** in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
12. [Sentence #181]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) The standard range plus ****Model** 3** with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and **Europe**.
13. [Sentence #189]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) So we will be really saying the right-hand drive ****Model** 3** and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries.
14. [Sentence #225]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and **Europe** and in the second half almost exclusively for ****North** **America****.
15. [Sentence #290]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for ****North** **America**** **Model** 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments?
16. [Sentence #297]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and **China** as well, but what we’re seeing in ****North** **America**** is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].
17. [Sentence #301]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) But on ****Model** 3**, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 **deliveries**, whatever that assumption is for ****Model** 3**, does your current order flow support that?
18. [Sentence #345]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) Is that basically saying that people in **Europe** and **China** are just going to need to wait longer to take their **deliveries** and you’re going to try to emphasize more in ****North** **America**** in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
19. [Sentence #346]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to **China**, **Europe** cars, and the second half is dedicated to **North** American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
20. [Sentence #437]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) Elon Musk

Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume, we’re driving units of the ****Model** 3** which is extremely efficient magnet motor and product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X.
21. [Sentence #456]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 ****Model** 3** and then to create a sort of bundled package for the ****Model** 3** with the increased range because we think actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important more people realizing in range and posher interior and Autopilot.
22. [Sentence #502]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) After the ****Model** 3** **ramp** from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
23. [Sentence #546]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly **global** manufacturer with major factories in ****North** **America****, **China** and **Europe** and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
24. [Sentence #556]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) This is our second large-scale product launch since ****Model** 3** in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and **ramp** efficiency.
25. [Sentence #560]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We also announced a long-range and performance variant of ****Model** 3** for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in **China**.
26. [Sentence #575]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Model** Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai.
27. [Sentence #580]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Note that one of the most important aspects of **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
28. [Sentence #615]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range ****Model** 3** basically tomorrow, **China** time.
29. [Sentence #620]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the ****Model** 3** in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
30. [Sentence #860]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to ****Model** 3** as well, and so we have experience with that both with ****Model** 3** in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
