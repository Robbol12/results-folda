So, I think we&#x27;ve made very clear that we&#x27;re -- the future is autonomous.
    I mean, it&#x27;s going to be -- I&#x27;ve actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that 
is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles.
    And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone.
    It&#x27;s not that there are no horses.
    Yes, there are some but they&#x27;re unusual.
    They&#x27;re niche.

    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.</span>
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.

    There&#x27;s no hard inference conditions, it&#x27;s everything is neural network, it&#x27;s very soft, it&#x27;s probabilistic.
    So it will adapt its probability distribution based on the new data that it&#x27;s getting.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do have some insight into how good the things will be in like, let&#x27;s say, three or four months because we have 
advanced models that are far more capable than what is in the car, but have some issues with them that we need to fix.
    So they are like there&#x27;ll be a step change improvement in the capabilities of the car, but it will have some quirks 
that are – that need to be addressed in order to release it.
    As Ashok was saying, we have to be very careful in what we release the fleet or to customers in general.
    So like – if we look at say <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.4</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>, which are really could arguably even be Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span>, Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span> because 
it&#x27;s pretty close to a total retrain of the neural nets in each case are substantially different.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we have good insight into where the model is, how well the car will perform, in, say, three or four months.</span>
    Ashok Elluswamy

Yes.
    In terms of scaling laws, people in the AI community generally talk about model scaling laws where they increase the
model size a lot and then their corresponding gains in performance, but we have also figured out scaling laws and other 
access in addition to the model side scaling, making also data scaling.
    You can increase the amount of data you use to train the neural network and that also gives similar gains and you 
can also scale up by training compute, you can train it for much longer or make more GPUs or more Dojo nodes and that 
also gives better performance, and you can also have architecture scaling where you count with better architectures that
for the same amount of compute for produce better results.
    So a combination of model size scaling, data scaling, training compute scaling and the architecture scaling, we can 
basically extract like, okay, with the continue scaling based on this – at this ratio, we can sort of predict future 
performance.
    Obviously, it takes time to do the experiments because it takes a few weeks to train, it takes a few weeks to 
collect tens of millions of video clips and process all of them, but you can estimate what’s going to be the future 
progress based on the trends that we have seen in the past, and they’re generally held true based on past data.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">earlier?</span>
    And how does it align with your AI and product road map?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    I mean, as Elon and Vaibhav both said, we are on plan to meet that in the first half of next year.
    Ambition has always been to lower the cost of our vehicles to increase the adoption of sustainable energy and 
transport.
    Part of that is lowering the cost of our current vehicles, which is where all of the personally owned vehicles that 
we sell today come in.
    But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the 
initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that&#x27;s really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI

    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

So, that&#x27;s not sandbagging or anything else.
    Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements 
thereafter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.</span>
    So, you don&#x27;t expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.

    You don&#x27;t expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it 
does.
    So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we&#x27;re doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in 
the software, we&#x27;ll roll out another sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
