Thank you.
    So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> million a year.
    So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.

    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.</span>
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.

    And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to market, less premium competitors.
    Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this resulted in -- but declined sequentially.
    This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in
