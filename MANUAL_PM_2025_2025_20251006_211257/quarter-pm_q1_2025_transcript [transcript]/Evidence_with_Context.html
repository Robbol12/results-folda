    Very strong IQOS gross margin expansion reflects the powerful growth and scale effect of this large and growing 
business, manufacturing productivity, and a comparison benefit from higher device shipment in the prior year when ILUMA 
i was launched in Japan.
    On an organic basis, combustible net revenues and gross profit grew by plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.8</span>% and plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.3</span>% respectively.
    While pricing was strong and volume were positive, there was a notably negative geographic mix this quarter due to 
growth in markets such as Turkey and Egypt, in addition to the technical impact from Indonesia.
    We expect gross pricing and negative geographic mix to moderate over the rest of the year and target combustible 
gross margin expansion organically and in dollar terms.
    As expected, input cost headwinds eased compared to recent years and based on current assumption, we expect this to 
further improve in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    Taking a closer look at our volumes, shipment growth of plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.9</span>% was primarily driven by our smoke-free business 
with all categories contributing positively and placing us on track for a fifth consecutive year of total volume growth.
    Smoke-free volumes grew by plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.4</span>%, above our full year target range of plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% to plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%, reflecting very 
positive contribution from IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition to the growth of these three brands, which I covered earlier, I would also note that our oral smoke-free</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">business includes US Moist Snuff and Scandinavian Snus, which declined modestly in the quarter.</span>
    Despite this, oral smoke-free product shipment growth accelerated versus the prior quarter to plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">27</span>%.
    Cigarette volumes were positive for the fourth consecutive quarter as we grew share in a modestly declining industry
with continuous growth in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted, such as Turkey and India.
    You have heard us talk recently about our multi-category strategy for smoke-free products as we leverage on the 
strengths of the IQOS brand and commercial infrastructure in international markets to accelerate incremental growth from
ZYN and VEEV.
    This is evidenced by our strong smoke-free portfolio results in Q1, with visible accretion across regions and 
markets.
    We have <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">46</span> markets with multiple smoke-free offerings, including <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> with all three PMI categories on offer.
    The execution of this three-pronged strategy is generating positive results in markets such as the Czech Republic, 
Romania, Switzerland and our global travel retail business, in addition to promising starts in the UK and Italy.
    It is also helping to bolster our position as a global smoke-free champion.

    In Q1, we delivered a very strong start to the year with all key elements of the business contributing strongly to 
deliver double-digit increases in organic net revenue, operating income, and adjusted diluted EPS in both constant 
currency and dollar terms.
    Our smoke-free business performed exceptionally well across all areas, with shipment volumes up plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.4</span>% 
year-on-year, organic net revenue growth of plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>%, and outstanding organic gross profit of plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">33</span>%, as all three 
smoke-free categories extended gross margins.
    This was especially fueled by the rapid growth of ZYN and the continued volume momentum, operating leverage, and 
scale benefit of IQOS.
    Our smoke-free business now accounts for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">44</span>% of total gross profit as we continue to deploy our multi-category 
strategy across markets and broaden our growth opportunities.
    IQOS delivered close to plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% HTU-adjusted IMS growth, with continued strong performance both in Japan and 
Europe, despite the annualization impact of the EU characterizing flavor ban.
    We expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year.
    ZYN, once again, delivered strong growth in the US, with shipments increasing by an impressive plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">53</span>% to reach <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">202</span>
million cans, exceeding our initial expectations as demand remained strong and production capacity increased ahead of 
schedule in the latter part of March, enabling some initial replenishment of trade inventories.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">the global dynamism of this emerging category.</span>
    In e-vapor, VEEV Q1 performance was impressive, demonstrating its increasing contribution within our multi-category 
offering.
    Shipments more than doubled year-on-year and gross margin further expanded, driven by strong pod growth in Europe as
we increase our distribution and commercial activity.
    Within combustible, overall volume growth, coupled with strong pricing and ongoing cost initiatives, drove a robust 
performance, despite notably negative geographic mix from increased volumes in lower margin markets.
    Overall, the very strong and increasingly profitable underlying growth of our smoke-free business was coupled with 
very solid combustible results and the added benefit of favorable shipment timing.
    This allowed us to deliver plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span>% organic operating income growth and plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">250</span> basis points of expansion in 
adjusted OI margin to reach <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40.7</span>% and resulted in strong double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in both currency 
neutral and dollar terms, despite currency headwinds.
    While it is early in the year and there are a number of uncertainties in the global economic outlook, we remain 
confident that we will achieve another year of super growth.
    As such, we now forecast double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth at prevailing exchange rates.
