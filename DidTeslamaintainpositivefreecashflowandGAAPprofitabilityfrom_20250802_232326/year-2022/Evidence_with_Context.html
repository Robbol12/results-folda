    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just to do a Q3 recap.
    Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
    We had our industry-leading operating margin reach <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>%.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And our free cash flow surpassed $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in Q3 and approached $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in the past </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> months.</span>
    As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
    On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars made in a week with very good quality 
and is ramping rapidly.
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.

    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> -- just going through the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> recap.
    It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
    It was our best year ever on every level.
    Team did an amazing job.
    It&#x27;s an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
    So, in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we delivered over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.3</span> million cars and achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>% operating margin, the highest among any volume 
carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; While doing so, we generated $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in net income and $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">7.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in free cash flow.</span>
    Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was an incredibly challenging year 
due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">production.</span>
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
    And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1218</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">negative impact on working capital.</span>
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
    Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound 
logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
    Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the 
final two weeks.
    As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound 
logistics.
    We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
    As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth in production this year, although we 
are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    It’s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can’t have that as an outcome.

    Can you hear me well?

Great.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I’d like to ask you some questions about free cash flow.</span>
    Do you -- so first, maybe in the long run, if you look at your performance and your growth model and your growth 
ambitions, I did the math very quick.
    And I see you guys sitting on $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> billion or maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion of cash at the end of the decade.
    And I was wondering if it’s something you have given some thoughts about.
    Elon Musk

If inflation keeps going crazy, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion might be like $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> billion today.
    I don’t know.
    So, we’ll see what $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot less.
    So, I don’t know if we’ll -- that seems like a lot of cash.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, it’s – manage price, frankly.
    But we have so much excess demand.
    That is really just not an issue for us.
    It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.
    Toni Sacconaghi

Okay.
    Thank you.
    Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> years from near life or death to a company with consistent </span>

    I am wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of
your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> years or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> years.
    I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn’t be on calls unless there is something unusual and you have been on 
every call since then.
    I am wondering how<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

I do a lot of unusual things, let’s face it.
    Basically, if there is only good news, I won’t be on the call.
    But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call – 
relatively speaking, if there is bad news.
    And we have this good news, then I won’t be on the call.
    But I am committed to the long – I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of 
sustainability and autonomy.

    Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
    And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    So as Elon mentioned, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was a terrific year for Tesla.
    I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a 
volatile year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; On a full year basis: revenue increased over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%, and </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">our margins remained industry-leading.</span>
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell

    We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.
    So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.
    It’s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China.
    And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

We still have it.
    Elon Musk

We still have our Dogecoin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.6</span>%.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown.</span>
    However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize.
    As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year.
    We are quite excited about this.
    A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress, Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on 
our margins for the balance of the year.
    However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp.
    Second, as we’ve mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog
flows through.
    However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story.

Yes.

    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">17.2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% with automotive gross margin at </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">27.9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%.</span>
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.

    George Gianarikas

I think, at your Annual Shareholders’ event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your 
production have started to come off the boil.
    If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases?

    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
    Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating 
margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.</span>
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">a </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So what we&#x27;re aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let&#x27;s say, for argument&#x27;s sake if Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> can be, 
say, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>% safer than human, Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> might be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span>%.
    It will be Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> beyond that.
    But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
    But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> with Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> is quite significant.
    So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is for Zach.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I think it&#x27;s probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial 
disclosures.
    But I&#x27;m happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business.
    So, we&#x27;re currently at a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.
    We&#x27;re growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% a quarter, so it&#x27;s growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.
    And in the states in which we&#x27;re operating, on average, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla 
Insurance product.
    And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We love his optimism for </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">own conclusions on progress being made?</span>
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> -- just going through the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> recap.
    It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
    It was our best year ever on every level.
    Team did an amazing job.
    It&#x27;s an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
    So, in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we delivered over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.3</span> million cars and achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>% operating margin, the highest among any volume 
carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
    While doing so, we generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> billion in net income and $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7.5</span> billion in free cash flow.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> was an incredibly challenging year </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.</span>
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
    So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.

Yes, exactly.
    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">credits for battery cells packs?</span>
    So $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">700</span> per long-range Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">45</span> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much 
does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
