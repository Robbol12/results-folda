[Year 2022] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2022 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

1. [Sentence #1141, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So just to do a Q3 recap.
     Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
     We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%.
>>> And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months.
     As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
     So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
     So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
     On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
     Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.

2. [Sentence #1701, TSLA_Q4_2022] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap.
     It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
     It was our best year ever on every level.
     Team did an amazing job.
     It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
     So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
>>> While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.
     Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
     So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
     [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that.
     The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.
     Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
     Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
     We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
-----
3. [Sentence #31, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
     The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
     Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
     OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items.
     As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%.
     Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April.
     These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars.
>>> Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production.
     Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
     Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
     First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
     Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
     This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
     Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
     And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
-----
4. [Sentence #1218, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
     On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
>>> Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
     Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.
     Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
     Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
     As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
     We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
     As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control.

5. [Sentence #384, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can’t have that as an outcome.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

Thanks.
     Can you hear me well?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Pierre Ferragu

Great.
>>> I’d like to ask you some questions about free cash flow.
     Do you -- so first, maybe in the long run, if you look at your performance and your growth model and your growth ambitions, I did the math very quick.
     And I see you guys sitting on $400 billion or maybe $500 billion of cash at the end of the decade.
     And I was wondering if it’s something you have given some thoughts about.
     Elon Musk

If inflation keeps going crazy, $500 billion might be like $20 billion today.
     I don’t know.
     So, we’ll see what $500 billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot less.
     So, I don’t know if we’ll -- that seems like a lot of cash.
-----
6. [Sentence #1062, TSLA_Q2_2022] [NO EVIDENCE]
     So, it’s – manage price, frankly.
     But we have so much excess demand.
     That is really just not an issue for us.
     It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Okay.
     Thank you.
     Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you.
>>> Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last 3 years from near life or death to a company with consistent cash flow and industry-leading margins.
     I am wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next 3 years or 4 years.
     I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn’t be on calls unless there is something unusual and you have been on every call since then.
     I am wondering how...

Elon Musk

I do a lot of unusual things, let’s face it.
     Basically, if there is only good news, I won’t be on the call.
     But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call – relatively speaking, if there is bad news.
     And we have this good news, then I won’t be on the call.
     But I am committed to the long – I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of sustainability and autonomy.
-----
7. [Sentence #1749, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Congratulations, guys.
     Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
     And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla.
     I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.
>>> On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
     Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further.
     For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
     Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.
     Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
     First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
     Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories.
     Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.
-----
8. [Sentence #653, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.
     So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.
     It’s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China.
     And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

We still have it.
     Elon Musk

We still have our Dogecoin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins at 14.6%.
>>> Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown.
     However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize.
     As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year.
     We are quite excited about this.
     A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress, Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on our margins for the balance of the year.
     However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp.
     Second, as we’ve mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog flows through.
     However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story.
-----
9. [Sentence #1210, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
>>> On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
     On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
-----
10. [Sentence #1512, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Get optimistic.
     Don’t change things.
     What matters is where are the most brilliant people working?
     And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I mean, like we don’t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future.
     Engineers are also cost conscious.
     And we don’t just burn the money out the window when we’re trying to do R&D.
>>> I wouldn’t stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for...

Elon Musk

I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars.
     You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do.
     You can’t make it up in volume.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.
     George Gianarikas

I think, at your Annual Shareholders’ event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil.
     If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases?
-----
11. [Sentence #48, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
     Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%.
     This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
>>> So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
     They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
     And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
     So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus ‘21.
     I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
     So, let’s see.
     Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
     So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
-----
12. [Sentence #1258, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
-----
13. [Sentence #1880, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So what we're aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let's say, for argument's sake if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%.
     It will be Hardware 5 beyond that.
     But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
     But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant.
     So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is for Zach.
>>> Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures.
     But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business.
     So, we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.
     We're growing 20% a quarter, so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.
     And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product.
     And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.
-----
14. [Sentence #87, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
     And basically, the future is very exciting.
     I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to first investor question.
     And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
>>> We love his optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being made?
     Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full self-driving.
     And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
     The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
     And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
     And I think we will achieve that this year.
-----
15. [Sentence #1702, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap.
     It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
     It was our best year ever on every level.
     Team did an amazing job.
     It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
     So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
     While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.
>>> Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
     So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
     [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that.
     The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.
     Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
     Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
     We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
     So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.
-----
16. [Sentence #1789, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
