[TSLA_Q4_2022] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2022 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap.
     It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
     It was our best year ever on every level.
     Team did an amazing job.
     It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
     So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
>>> While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.
     Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
     So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
     [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that.
     The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.
     Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
     Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
     We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.

     Congratulations, guys.
     Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
     And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla.
     I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.
>>> On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
     Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further.
     For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
     Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.
     Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
     First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
     Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories.
     Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.

3. [Sentence #197] [UNCERTAIN]
     So what we're aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let's say, for argument's sake if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%.
     It will be Hardware 5 beyond that.
     But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
     But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant.
     So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is for Zach.
>>> Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures.
     But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business.
     So, we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.
     We're growing 20% a quarter, so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.
     And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product.
     And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.

     So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap.
     It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
     It was our best year ever on every level.

     Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
     We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
     So itâ€™s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.

5. [Sentence #106] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
