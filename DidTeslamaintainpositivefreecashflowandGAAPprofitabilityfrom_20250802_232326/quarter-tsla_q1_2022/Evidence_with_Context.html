    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">production.</span>
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
    And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.

    It’s going to retard the growth of what is inherently a good thing that we can’t have that as an outcome.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

Thanks.
    Can you hear me well?

Yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

Great.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I’d like to ask you some questions about free cash flow.</span>
    Do you -- so first, maybe in the long run, if you look at your performance and your growth model and your growth 
ambitions, I did the math very quick.
    And I see you guys sitting on $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> billion or maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion of cash at the end of the decade.
    And I was wondering if it’s something you have given some thoughts about.
    Elon Musk

If inflation keeps going crazy, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion might be like $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> billion today.
    I don’t know.
    So, we’ll see what $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot less.
    So, I don’t know if we’ll -- that seems like a lot of cash.

    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
    Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating 
margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.</span>
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">87</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
    And basically, the future is very exciting.
    I’ve never been more optimistic or excited about Tesla’s future than I am right now.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We love his optimism for </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">own conclusions on progress being made?</span>
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
