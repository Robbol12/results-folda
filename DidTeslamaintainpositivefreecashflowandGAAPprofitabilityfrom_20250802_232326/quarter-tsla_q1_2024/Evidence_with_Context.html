Mark, is it helpful?
    Mark Delaney

Yes, very helpful.
    Thank you.
    My follow-up was to better understand Tesla&#x27;s approach to pricing going forward.
    Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the 
cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has 
in place.
    Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">with the current product set?</span>
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
    Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut 
like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a 
great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.
    That’s true of any area.

    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24.6</span>%.
    We expect the energy storage deployments for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> to grow at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">75</span>% higher from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
    Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our
control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
    On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future
projects, marketing, and other activities.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We had negative free cash flow of $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in the first quarter.</span>
    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient 
manner.
    The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and 
ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
    In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely 
rewarding.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

    I&#x27;ll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you 
indoors and that you can escape, we&#x27;re talking terminator-level risk.
    And yes, I&#x27;d be uncomfortable with.
    If there&#x27;s not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed.
    And if there&#x27;s shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can&#x27;t say

    That is a fact.
    They have an opportunity.

    Maybe one final question and I&#x27;ll pass it on.
    OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there.
    I&#x27;d be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount 
reductions.

    We are making sure that we&#x27;re being as efficient as possible in our training.
    It&#x27;s not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they&#x27;re used.
    So, in conclusion, we&#x27;re super excited about our autonomy road map.
    I think it should be obvious to anyone who&#x27;s driving Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> and it tells that that it is only a matter of time 
before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that.
    And we&#x27;re really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future.
    And I&#x27;ll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous 
will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone.
    And that will become very obvious in hindsight.

Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.9</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
