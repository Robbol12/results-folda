    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.2</span> million units delivered.
    The energy storage business delivered nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> gigawatt hours of batteries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.5</span> gigawatt hours 
the year before.
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.

    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full

    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior

    But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term.
    So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at.
    I mean, Zachary?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I fully agree with you.
    I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we 
generating enough money to continue to invest.
    And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense.
    It’s intense in terms of investment; it’s intense in terms of potential.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing </span>

Yes.
    We actually make our share<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest.
    That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction.
    Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest?
    Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we’ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and
with -- a set of that we’ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest
the cash.

Mark, is it helpful?
    Mark Delaney

Yes, very helpful.
    Thank you.
    My follow-up was to better understand Tesla&#x27;s approach to pricing going forward.
    Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the 
cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has 
in place.
    Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">with the current product set?</span>
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
    Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut 
like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a 
great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.
    That’s true of any area.

    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
    The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.
    Just to level set, this was about $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">622</span> million of charge, which got recorded in the period.
    And I want people to remember that we&#x27;ve called it out separately on the financials.
    Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related 
activities and higher legal and other costs.
    On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> billion in 
CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online.
    This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives.

cash and investments.
    Once again, we&#x27;ve begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed.
    It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved.
    Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
    Now let&#x27;s go to investor questions.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24.6</span>%.
    We expect the energy storage deployments for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> to grow at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">75</span>% higher from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
    Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our
control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
    On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future
projects, marketing, and other activities.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We had negative free cash flow of $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in the first quarter.</span>
    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient 
manner.
    The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and 
ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
    In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely 
rewarding.

Thanks, Martin.
    Good afternoon, everyone.
    As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as 
record deployments in our energy business.
    This was achieved despite <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.

    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
    For <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from

    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion.
    And for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
    In conclusion, like Elon said, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.
    There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the 
pace for the next phase of growth.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just to do a Q3 recap.
    Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
    We had our industry-leading operating margin reach <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>%.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And our free cash flow surpassed $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in Q3 and approached $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in the past </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> months.</span>
    As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
    On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars made in a week with very good quality 
and is ramping rapidly.
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24.6</span>%.
    We expect the energy storage deployments for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> to grow at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">75</span>% higher from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
    Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our
control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
    On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future
projects, marketing, and other activities.
    We had negative free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> billion in the first quarter.
    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.</span>
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient 
manner.
    The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and 
ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
    In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely 
rewarding.
    Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
    And we can open it up to Q&amp;A.

    Thank you.
    My follow-up was to better understand Tesla&#x27;s approach to pricing going forward.
    Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the 
cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has 
in place.
    Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
    And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis 
with the current product set?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.</span>
    Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut 
like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a 
great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.
    That’s true of any area.
    So over time, we do need to keep making sure that we’re – that it’s a great product at a great price.
    And moreover, that price is accessible to people.
    So it’s not – you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question.

    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
    Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be 
manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
    The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then 
we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">of a very high interest rate environment.</span>
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> and years to come.

    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> -- just going through the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> recap.
    It was a fantastic year for Tesla.
    It was our best year ever on every level.
    Team did an amazing job.
    It&#x27;s an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.
    So, in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we delivered over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.3</span> million cars and achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>% operating margin, the highest among any volume 
carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; While doing so, we generated $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in net income and $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">7.5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion in free cash flow.</span>
    Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was an incredibly challenging year 
due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges.
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">production.</span>
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
    And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">negative impact on working capital.</span>
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
    Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound 
logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
    Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the 
final two weeks.
    As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound 
logistics.
    We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
    As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth in production this year, although we

    Do you -- so first, maybe in the long run, if you look at your performance and your growth model and your growth 
ambitions, I did the math very quick.
    And I see you guys sitting on $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> billion or maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion of cash at the end of the decade.
    And I was wondering if it’s something you have given some thoughts about.
    Elon Musk

If inflation keeps going crazy, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion might be like $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> billion today.
    I don’t know.
    So, we’ll see what $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion buys you in a decade, but it might be a lot less.
    So, I don’t know if we’ll -- that seems like a lot of cash.

    Thank you.
    Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> years from near life or death to a company with consistent </span>

every call since then.
    I am wondering how<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

I do a lot of unusual things, let’s face it.
    Basically, if there is only good news, I won’t be on the call.
    But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call – 
relatively speaking, if there is bad news.
    And we have this good news, then I won’t be on the call.
    But I am committed to the long – I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of 
sustainability and autonomy.

    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.</span>
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.

    Congratulations, guys.
    Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
    And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    So as Elon mentioned, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> was a terrific year for Tesla.
    I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a 
volatile year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; On a full year basis: revenue increased over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%, and </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">our margins remained industry-leading.</span>
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.

    We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.
    So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.
    It’s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China.
    And we have not sold any of our Dogecoin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

We still have it.
    Elon Musk

We still have our Dogecoin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Despite these challenges, we were still able to achieve one of our strongest operating margins at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.6</span>%.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown.</span>
    However, we expect this will show as a benefit in Q3 as our working capital-related cash flows restabilize.
    As we look ahead and as Elon mentioned, we are positioned for a record-breaking second half of the year.
    We are quite excited about this.
    A couple of things to keep in mind as we progress, Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies will continue to weigh on 
our margins for the balance of the year.
    However, the impact should reduce as we increase ramp.
    Second, as we’ve mentioned before, we expect to continue to see recognized global pricing to increase as our backlog
flows through.
    However, macroeconomic-related cost increases will also continue to be part of our story.

    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.

    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
    However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">$</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">8.9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">]</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">(</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">ph</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">)</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> and free cash flows of</span>

    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">that people can afford.</span>
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

    I&#x27;ll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you 
indoors and that you can escape, we&#x27;re talking terminator-level risk.

    And if there&#x27;s shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can&#x27;t say 
that.
    That is a fact.
    They have an opportunity.

    Maybe one final question and I&#x27;ll pass it on.
    OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there.
    I&#x27;d be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount

    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
    Good afternoon, everyone.
    As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as 
record deployments in our energy business.
    This was achieved despite <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.

    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
    On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">17.2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% with automotive gross margin at </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">27.9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">%.</span>
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.

    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
    Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating 
margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.</span>
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.

    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.

    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>

    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
