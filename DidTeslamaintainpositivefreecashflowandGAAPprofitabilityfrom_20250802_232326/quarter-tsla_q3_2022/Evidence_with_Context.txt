     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So just to do a Q3 recap.
     Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
     We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%.
>>> And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months.
     As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
     So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
     So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
     On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
     Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.

     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
     On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
>>> Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
     Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.
     Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
     Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
     As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
     We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
     As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control.

     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
>>> On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.

     Elon Musk

Get optimistic.
     Don’t change things.
     What matters is where are the most brilliant people working?
     And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I mean, like we don’t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future.
     Engineers are also cost conscious.
     And we don’t just burn the money out the window when we’re trying to do R&D.
>>> I wouldn’t stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for...

Elon Musk

I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars.
     You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do.
     You can’t make it up in volume.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.
     George Gianarikas

I think, at your Annual Shareholders’ event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil.
     If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases?

     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
