[Year 2024] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2022 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

1. [Sentence #417, TSLA_Q1_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Mark, is it helpful?
     Mark Delaney

Yes, very helpful.
     Thank you.
     My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward.
     Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place.
     Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
>>> And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
     Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.
     That’s true of any area.

     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
     The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.
     Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period.
     And I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials.
     Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal and other costs.
     On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online.
     This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives.
>>> We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2.
     This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments.
     Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed.
     It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved.
     Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.

Great.
     Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
     Now let's go to investor questions.

3. [Sentence #71, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
     We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products.
     Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.
     We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.
     And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
     Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
     On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing, and other activities.
>>> We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
     The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
     We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
     In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding.

     Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses.
     Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
     Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
     The biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
     The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
     For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
     It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
>>> Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite capex increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year.
     Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
     While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits.
     The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13.
     Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $5 billion.
     And for 2025, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
     In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.
     There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the pace for the next phase of growth.

     And moreover, that price is accessible to people.
     So it’s not – you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question.

     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
>>> Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
     We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

     I'll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and that you can escape, we're talking terminator-level risk.
     And yes, I'd be uncomfortable with.
     If there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed.
     And if there's shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can't say that.
     That is a fact.
     They have an opportunity.
     And yes, we'll see.
>>> If the company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.
     Alex Potter

All right.
     That's actually all very helpful context.
     Thank you.
     Maybe one final question and I'll pass it on.
     OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there.
     I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions.
     What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks?

     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, to recap, as someone was saying, something that what -- the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3.
     Tesla, at the same time, has achieved record deliveries.
     In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable.
     And I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company that is profitable.
>>> So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us.
     So, we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla.
     That's staggering the immense amount of work to make 7 million cars.
     So, you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.
     And as you all know, on October 10, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot.
     And we had 50 autonomous vehicles.
     There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Ys, operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of people with no incidents the entire night.
     And all those who went there that worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels, meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to and the whole night went very smoothly.

     And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world and probably by a long shot.
     I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future.
     Thank you.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much, Elon.
     And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
>>> Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion.
     Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
     While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing incentives.
     As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
     We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter.
     We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year.
     To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
     And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.

11. [Sentence #49, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training.
     It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used.
     So, in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy road map.
     I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 and it tells that that it is only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that.
     And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future.
     And I'll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone.
     And that will become very obvious in hindsight.
>>> We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead.
     Thanks.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
     It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
     We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
     Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5%.
     Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality.

12. [Sentence #656, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs.
     So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.
     And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla.
     We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.
     And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.
>>> Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues.
     Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.
     And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
     We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
     But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
     The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
     In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
     So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
