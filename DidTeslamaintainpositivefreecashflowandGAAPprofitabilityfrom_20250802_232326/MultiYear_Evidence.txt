[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2022 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) And our [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months.
2. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record [white on yellow]profitability[/white on yellow] for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
3. [Sentence #18]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow].
4. [Sentence #21]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow] positive.
5. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow] positive at a price that people can afford.
6. [Sentence #31]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Our [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production.
7. [Sentence #34]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) [white on yellow][white on yellow]Free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
8. [Sentence #48]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record [white on yellow]profitability[/white on yellow] and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
9. [Sentence #53]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow] from operations.
10. [Sentence #54]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) This year itself, we have generated operating [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows of approximately $2.3 billion.
11. [Sentence #64]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows.
12. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] in spite of a very high interest rate environment.
13. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
14. [Sentence #71]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We had negative [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
15. [Sentence #73]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] to return to positive again.
16. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] to end the year with over $29 billion of [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] and investments on hand.
17. [Sentence #81]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Our 2023 [white on yellow]GAAP[/white on yellow] net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-[white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
18. [Sentence #84]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On automotive [white on yellow]profitability[/white on yellow], our [white on yellow]GAAP[/white on yellow] operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
19. [Sentence #92]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Our [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
20. [Sentence #94]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) We reverted to positive [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] of $1.3 billion in Q2.
21. [Sentence #96]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Our [white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] flows were impacted by working capital related to the Shanghai factory shutdown.
22. [Sentence #117]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
23. [Sentence #202]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Our [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite capex increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] of $3.6 billion for the year.
24. [Sentence #324]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Elon Musk

Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology.
25. [Sentence #326]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) If the company generates a lot of positive [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow], we could obviously buy back shares.
26. [Sentence #384]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) I’d like to ask you some questions about [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow].
27. [Sentence #386]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) I wouldn’t stop looking at like R&D as a [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] investment for...

Elon Musk

I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars.
28. [Sentence #417]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] positive on an annual basis with the current product set?
29. [Sentence #420]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) I think we can be [white on yellow][white on yellow]free[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow][/white on yellow] positive meaningfully.
30. [Sentence #505]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last 3 years from near life or death to a company with consistent [white on yellow]cash[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]flow[/white on yellow] and industry-leading margins.
