    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.2</span> million units delivered.
    The energy storage business delivered nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> gigawatt hours of batteries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.5</span> gigawatt hours 
the year before.
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.

    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full

    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior

    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
    Good afternoon, everyone.
    As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as 
record deployments in our energy business.
    This was achieved despite <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> financials, we ended the year with over $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">96</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion of revenue and generated $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4.4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> billion of free </span>

    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of
Cybertruck ramp.
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">66</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">NO EVIDENCE</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
    Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be 
manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
    The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then 
we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.
    Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, 
perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">of a very high interest rate environment.</span>
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> and years to come.
    Thank you.
