    But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term.
    So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at.
    I mean, Zachary?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I fully agree with you.
    I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we 
generating enough money to continue to invest.
    And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense.
    It’s intense in terms of investment; it’s intense in terms of potential.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">massive amounts of money in new technology.</span>
    That is super hard.

And vertical integration.
    It’s not even just like new products, but also<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes.
    We actually make our share<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest.
    That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction.
    Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest?
    Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we’ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and
with -- a set of that we’ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest
the cash.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">the revenue model?</span>
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

    Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly.
    I’d recommend looking at ARK Invest.
    I think their analysis is very good.
    It’s the best.
    And generally, Fintwit or the finance, Smart Finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts.
    They’re great.
    So that’s in my opinion where you’ll get the best info.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment.</span>
    And don’t sweat when things go up and down.
    In fact, if the market panics, buy; if the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time.
    But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term.
    So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at.
