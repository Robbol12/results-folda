[Multi-Year Analysis] tell me about the cost of producing  a cybertruck for tesla from 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #3549, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
     Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
>>> And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

2. [Sentence #2892, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
     Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
     When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.

3. [Sentence #3884, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
     This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
     As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
     In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
     Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
>>> This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
-----
4. [Sentence #3546, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
     So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
     And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.

7. [Sentence #4025, TSLA_Q4_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive.
     But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
     So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
     It's extremely expensive.
     And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
     So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?
     Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
     But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
     It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
     So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production.
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
-----
8. [Sentence #588, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.
     And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
     So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
>>> And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
-----
9. [Sentence #3341, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
     So, that's a good result.
     But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
     So, if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
     And the same is true of this year.
     So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
     It would not make any sense because we'll still be part constrained.
>>> We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
     That is most likely.
     But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
     So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
     This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
     If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
     Capital equipment is distilled labor.
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
-----
10. [Sentence #3968, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
     Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
     It was no small feat.
     Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
     As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
>>> Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.

11. [Sentence #1656, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
     If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.
     And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
     This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
     And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
     In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
     Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
>>> We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
     And we are very, very excited about that product.
     I think it might actually be our best product ever.
     Let’s see.
     And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
     And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world.
     We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
     I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.

12. [Sentence #1655, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.

-----
13. [Sentence #93, TSLA_Q1_2021] [PLAN]
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
     First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
     For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition.
     And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
     Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities.
>>> While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
     We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
     If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
     This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
     So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
     On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overheads.
     On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
     This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
     We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?

     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
-----
16. [Sentence #553, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
     We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
     The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
     Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
     OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items.
     As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%.
     Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April.
>>> These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars.
     Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production.
     Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
     Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
     First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
     Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
     This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
     Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
-----

     There’s latency.

     There’s latency.

That’s why I say that the Fed’s decisions make sense if you’re looking out through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield.
     And actually we’ve got front windshield.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down.
>>> There is a small amount of production that we’re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it’s less than 10% of the total increases we’ve seen so far.
     So we’re optimistic here based upon what we’re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will start to come in over time.
     But I just want to set expectations that there’s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We’ll probably see some cost reduction in 2023.
     I’ll be surprised if we did not.
     George Gianarikas

And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon.
     With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?
-----
18. [Sentence #2264, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
     As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
     As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
     Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
     As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
     Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.
     And so, you can extrapolate that out.
     There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.
     There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.
     But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.

     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
>>> And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year.
     So it's an incredible product.
     I can't wait to drive it personally.
     It will be the car that I drive every day.
     I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
     And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.
     So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed.
     Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human.

21. [Sentence #2412, TSLA_Q3_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
     Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
>>> We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
     As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
     And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
     There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.
     We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.
     Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

22. [Sentence #1895, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
     So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2.
     But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
     And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some contracts in place.
     But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
     So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our financials.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?
     Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
     Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.

23. [Sentence #4127, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to reduce costs.
     Pierre Ferragu

Excellent.
     Thank you.
     And I…

Martin Viecha

Sorry, do you want to go say something?
     Andrew Baglino

I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet.
     And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product.
     So over the course of 2023 on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need, or we have more content than we need, without impacting reliability at all.
>>> And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023.
     So we're not just sort of relying on supply.
     We're also doing design actions to bring cost out.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
     So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
     I'm just guessing here.
     So, this is -- that would be my guess.

24. [Sentence #3718, TSLA_Q4_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
     You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
     That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
     And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
>>> If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
     If an asset has 5 times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.
     So, if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because still you don't want to drive.
     So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
     So, it's probably better than 5 times, I don't know.
     Yes.

25. [Sentence #3717, TSLA_Q4_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     I just do not understand how profound change this is.
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.

26. [Sentence #3707, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And so, -- and the value of that will be a very big number.
     I just look at this as asset utilization.
     You have a passenger car, which normally is driven maybe 1.5 hours a day on average, maybe 10 -- 10 hours, 10, 12 hours a week, a lot of cars are in parking lots.
     So, we're spending money, not just driving the cars but storing them all over the place.
     We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.
     But there will be a challenge with traffic.
     So, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, and now I think it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of cars on the road.
>>> I mean, it's going to be -- I think it's way cheaper to draw a price point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past three or four years will be capable of that, than a bus or a subway, will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.
     So, if we want to get -- I'm not going to take the bus.
     If it costs you -- I don't know for arguments sake $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, taking the bus, especially in cold weather or dark or maybe a little bit dangerous or that.
     I just do not understand how profound change this is.
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.

27. [Sentence #552, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
     Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
     We also recognized a onetime benefit of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
     The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
     Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
     OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items.
     As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%.
>>> Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April.
     These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable cars.
     Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned production.
     Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
     Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
     First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
     Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
     This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
-----
28. [Sentence #3829, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
     So, basically, price really matters.
     I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it.
     And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
     It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is.
     And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so.
     And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
>>> We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah.
     With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
     This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
     And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
     And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
     Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
-----
29. [Sentence #4069, TSLA_Q4_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year.
     We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential.
     So – and I think there would be demand for that, too.
     Rod Lache

Yeah.
     Thanks for clarifying that.
     And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate.
     Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter?
>>> And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night?
     If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the – of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     And it goes back to the point, I was making.
     I said, it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just damn good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world.

30. [Sentence #1687, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
     The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
     Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
     While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics.
     The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit economics.
     Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year.
     We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these challenges.
>>> Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related startup costs have wound down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS.
     Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to Fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other.
     We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.
     Elon Musk

Yes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our Bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate.
     So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China.
     We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.
     So this should not be taken as some verdict on Bitcoin.
     It’s just that we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given COVID shutdowns in China.
