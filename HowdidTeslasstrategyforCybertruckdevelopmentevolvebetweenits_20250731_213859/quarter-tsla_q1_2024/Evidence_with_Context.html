    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s start with investor Q&amp;A.
    The first question is, what is the status of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    What is the current output?
    Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production increased about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> 
gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four </span>

    Because we&#x27;re ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the 
lines and production volume increases.
    So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is on Optimus.
    So what is the current status of Optimus?
    Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
    When do you expect to start mass production?

<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> million cars?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

A little less?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It will be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> million cars in a year or so and then <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of 
millions of cars.
    Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?</span>
    Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.

[Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
    Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage 
deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy 
business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production in the second half of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, so we expect it to be more like the early </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, if not late this year.</span>
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
    It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras 
and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> on in North America.
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
