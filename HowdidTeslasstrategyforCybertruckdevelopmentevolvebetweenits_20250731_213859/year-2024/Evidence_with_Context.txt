[Year 2024] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #88, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's start with investor Q&A.
     The first question is, what is the status of 4680.
     What is the current output?
     Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Sure.
     4680 production increased about 18% to 20% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
>>> We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four lines in Phase 1, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp.
     Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases.
     So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is on Optimus.
     So what is the current status of Optimus?
     Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
     When do you expect to start mass production?
-----
2. [Sentence #1465, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they're not like obviously super futuristic.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
     What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
     So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we're progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory in Reno.
>>> We've released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production.
     Semi growth will largely depend on our customers' adoption of the product.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don't think we're going to be limited, honestly.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
     We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it's about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it's a no brainer.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.

3. [Sentence #203, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

5 million cars?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
-----
4. [Sentence #87, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     And we can open it up to Q&A.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's start with investor Q&A.
     The first question is, what is the status of 4680.

     Martin Viecha

     The second question is on Optimus.
     So what is the current status of Optimus?
     Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
-----
5. [Sentence #2074, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     That's $1 billion a month at some point probably.
     But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
     So, yes, $1 billion a month is a lot but it's not it's going to be like 1% of Optimus.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
     Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles?
>>> And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's capex?
     I think they're referring to cost there.
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They're really asking the tough questions, aren't they?
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven't started working on Hardware 3 yet.
     We are still making software releases.
     We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously.
     People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
     So, we're not giving up on Hardware.
-----
6. [Sentence #2039, TSLA_Q4_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And then I said like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- I'm confident at 1 million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000.
     If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car.
     So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over 1 million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that.
     What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
     The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?
     And how will it impact revenue and scale?
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.
     So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the weather.
     In Reno, you never know what's going to happen.
     But we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
     The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in 2025 and begin ramping early in 2026.
     But as we've said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
-----
7. [Sentence #762, TSLA_Q2_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
     Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
     Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
     Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
     Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
     Lars Moravy

Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
     We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
>>> We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that.
     We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is any update on Dojo?
     Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware.
     And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.
     And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them.
-----
8. [Sentence #680, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver.
     And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph).
     We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other things.
     So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil.
     We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date.
     So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer.
     With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
>>> And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year.
     This will be for Tesla consumption.
     It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
     But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories.
     And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers.
     That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus.
     For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
-----
9. [Sentence #847, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.
     You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.
     So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest.
     Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on.
     That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.
     We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.
     With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
>>> So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.
     So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved.
     Those are the two choices.
     This wasn't they would come to Tesla.
     They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.
     So, yes.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
     So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum.

10. [Sentence #1457, TSLA_Q3_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And this is what's wrong.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
     Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we're pulling that.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     Most the time, you don't need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
     The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
>>> And that's why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people don't realize that it has so much capability.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they're not like obviously super futuristic.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
     What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?

11. [Sentence #755, TSLA_Q2_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving.
     It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
     So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
     I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
     So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
     That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
     Travis Axelrod

Thank you very much.

12. [Sentence #719, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
     Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
>>> Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.
     Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.
     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

13. [Sentence #717, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
     It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.

     These comments are based on predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year.
>>> So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.
     Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024.
     Where to invest $1,000 right now

That's worth noting.
     Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, No.
     1 was Model Y.
     We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don't know what -- really, I was going to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing frankly.

15. [Sentence #20, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
     Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
>>> We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
     It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
     And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
     Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.
     It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America.
     So it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
