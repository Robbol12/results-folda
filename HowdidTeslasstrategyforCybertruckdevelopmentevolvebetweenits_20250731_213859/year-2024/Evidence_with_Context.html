    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s start with investor Q&amp;A.
    The first question is, what is the status of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    What is the current output?
    Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production increased about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> 
gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">lines in Phase </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we&#x27;re ahead of the ramp.</span>
    Because we&#x27;re ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the 
lines and production volume increases.
    So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is on Optimus.
    So what is the current status of Optimus?
    Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
    When do you expect to start mass production?

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
    What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2026</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and ramping really throughout the year </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">to full production.</span>
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it&#x27;s really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
    We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it&#x27;s about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it&#x27;s a no brainer.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

A little less?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It will be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> million cars in a year or so and then <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of 
millions of cars.
    Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?</span>
    Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.

    But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
    So, yes, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion a month is a lot but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s going to be like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>% of Optimus.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> vehicles?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
    So, we&#x27;re not giving up on Hardware.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2039</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
    So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see 
Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?</span>
    And how will it impact revenue and scale?
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.
    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
    Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
    Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather 
than earnings calls.
    Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
    Our next question is, what is the current status of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
    Lars Moravy

Yes, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">51</span>% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
    We currently produce more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> Cybertrucks of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells per week, and we&#x27;ll continue to ramp output as we 
drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">a huge technical milestone and we&#x27;re super proud of that.</span>
    We&#x27;re on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly 
below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> program.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is any update on Dojo?
    Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by NVIDIA&#x27;s execution and the capability of their
hardware.
    And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it&#x27;s often difficult to get the GPUs.
    And there just seems this, I guess I&#x27;m quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs
when we want them.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand 
driver.
    And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to 
unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>V3<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>.
    We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle --
sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a 
couple of other things.
    So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the 
product unveil.
    We&#x27;re also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to
date.
    So it will be an incremental for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> H100s plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> of our hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> AI5 Tesla AI computer.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we expect to have Optimus production Version </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> in limited production starting early next year.</span>
    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> of Optimus.
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.

    But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.
    You can&#x27;t just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it&#x27;s not possible.
    So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla&#x27;s interest, not contrary to Tesla&#x27;s interest.
    Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can&#x27;t turn on.
    That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.
    We are moving the GPUs in there and we&#x27;ll bring them online.
    With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and not on Tesla&#x27;s specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.</span>
    So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not 
involved.
    Those are the two choices.
    This wasn&#x27;t they would come to Tesla.
    They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.
    So, yes.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full 
time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there&#x27;s the other spectrum of AI which we&#x27;re not working on, and that&#x27;s the 
kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
    So you have to keep that in mind that it&#x27;s a broad spectrum.

I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full 
self-driving.
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
    I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
    So next year seems highly probable to me based on  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
    That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.

    Lars Moravy

Yes, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">51</span>% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
    We currently produce more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> Cybertrucks of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells per week, and we&#x27;ll continue to ramp output as we 
drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
    We&#x27;ve built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is

    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the

    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
    Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage 
deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy 
business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup </span>

    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.

and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> on in North America.
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
