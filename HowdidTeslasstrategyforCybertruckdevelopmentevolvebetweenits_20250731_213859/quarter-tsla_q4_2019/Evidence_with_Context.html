    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years.
    If you look back <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years from today to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> times more cars in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> then we 
produced in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2010</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
    So where we will be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.

    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">such product should look.</span>
    So it really just from the standpoint of what&#x27;s the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks 
the ass of any pickup truck, basically that&#x27;s the goal.
    And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand 
has been incredible.
    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to

    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> or Model Y cars.</span>
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.
