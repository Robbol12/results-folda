[TSLA_Q2_2022] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #52] [PLAN]
     Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
     If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.
     And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
     This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
     And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
     In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
>>> Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
     We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
     And we are very, very excited about that product.
     I think it might actually be our best product ever.
     Let’s see.
     And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
     And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world.
     We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.

3. [Sentence #292] [UNCERTAIN]
     It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
     So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2.
     But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
     And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some contracts in place.
     But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
     So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our financials.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?
     Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
     Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.

4. [Sentence #44] [PLAN]
     So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
     As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
     We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
     So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
     And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
     So, it’s good on every level.
     But this journey is not over.
>>> We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
     Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.

     Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
     It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
     Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
>>> The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
     And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain.
     The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount battery output per year?
     This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
     So yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
     I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
     And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible?
