    But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
    So, yes, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion a month is a lot but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s going to be like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>% of Optimus.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> vehicles?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
    So, we&#x27;re not giving up on Hardware.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">302</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
    So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see 
Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?</span>
    And how will it impact revenue and scale?
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.
    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.

Thank you.
    So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> million a year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.</span>
