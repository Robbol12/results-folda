All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.

    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
