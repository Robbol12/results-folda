Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.

    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
    Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.</span>
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">26</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
    It&#x27;s simpler.
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
