[TSLA_Q3_2022] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #165] [PLAN]
     Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
     Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
     When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.

2. [Sentence #132] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

3. [Sentence #509] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Before incentive.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
     We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?

4. [Sentence #182] [PLAN]
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
>>> And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.

5. [Sentence #24] [PILOT]
     So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
     So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
     On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly.
     Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
     We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
>>> And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
     We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.

6. [Sentence #180] [PLAN]
     Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
     That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
>>> So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
     And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.

7. [Sentence #254] [UNCERTAIN]
     And we try to model out like, let’s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year.
     Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
     Once you get out of that…

Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold.
     When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
     And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
>>> Elon Musk

Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously.
     At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
     So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
     It will be smaller, to be clear.
     But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
     I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.
     But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.
     So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.
