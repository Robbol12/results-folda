    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long

    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.

Thank you.

    What is the initial Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.

    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>

    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

I just wanted to follow up on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>-mile range.
    Just to be clear, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> miles with the cargo.
    Yes, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> miles with the cargo on level ground.
    Yes, sure.
    Not up.

    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
    On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars made in a week with very good quality 
and is ramping rapidly.
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.</span>
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.

Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the
second platform with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, led to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% reduction in cost of goods sold.
    When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
    And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">obviously.</span>
    At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
    So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about
the cost of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y platform.
    It will be smaller, to be clear.
    But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
    I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into 
that platform.
    But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>-for-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> target.
