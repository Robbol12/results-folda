[Year 2023] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #24]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Regarding the **Cybertruck**, we continue to build Alpha versions of the **Cybertruck** on our pilot line for testing purposes.
2. [Sentence #26]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so **production** starts out slow and then accelerates.
3. [Sentence #54]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) I want to **start** by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle **production** and deliveries.
4. [Sentence #71]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the **Cybertruck** next-generation platform, in-house cell **production**, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
5. [Sentence #141]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp **production** ahead of **Cybertruck** next year.
6. [Sentence #175]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for **Cybertruck** and any new features that will make it to **production**?
7. [Sentence #637]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) With regard to our **Cybertruck**, we continue to build our release candidates of the **Cybertruck** on our final **production** line in Austin.
8. [Sentence #669]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as **Cybertruck**, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend.
9. [Sentence #695]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our **Cybertruck** cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current **production**.
10. [Sentence #700]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 **production** system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
11. [Sentence #765]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) I do want to emphasize that the **Cybertruck** has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.
12. [Sentence #990]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, **Cybertruck** is going to be some contribution.
13. [Sentence #1166]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) The **Cybertruck**, I know a lot of people are excited about the **Cybertruck**.
14. [Sentence #1170]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume **production** with the **Cybertruck**, and then in making a **Cybertruck** cash flow positive.
15. [Sentence #1200]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to **Cybertruck** prototype builds and pilot **production** testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
16. [Sentence #1217]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) How many **Cybertruck** deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
17. [Sentence #1240]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) The **Cybertruck** cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started **production** on line two in Texas.
18. [Sentence #1241]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) This quarter we convert to building a 100% **Cybertruck** cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three quarters.
19. [Sentence #1271]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.
20. [Sentence #1446]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping **Cybertruck**, which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with.
21. [Sentence #1560]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like **Cybertruck**, which we talked about.
22. [Sentence #1644]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023.
23. [Sentence #1745]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Given that you moved the **start** of the next-generation compact vehicle **production** to Austin, has the **timeline** improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
24. [Sentence #1748]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) But our current schedule shows that we will **start** **production** towards the end of 2025.
25. [Sentence #1766]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will **start** **production** next year.
26. [Sentence #1846]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) When will Tesla **start** construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
27. [Sentence #2097]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) To what extent do you think **Cybertruck** is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
