So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go through investor questions.
    Question number one is from Michael.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
    I don&#x27;t want to blow your minds, but I&#x27;m often optimistic regarding time.
    But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    So sometime in the second half.
    That&#x27;s just what our current schedule says.
    But there&#x27;s a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
    The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the 
engineers to be living on the line.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">71</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, to date, over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.

    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
    First, I&#x27;m wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen 
platform.
    You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and 
powertrain.
    Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
    And do you believe -- we know that there&#x27;s a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> 
volts architecture, really employing your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> batteries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don&#x27;t think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
    We&#x27;re obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
    When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
    You don&#x27;t just throw it on the line and just build it.
    So we&#x27;re going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
    Sure, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it&#x27;s something we hope the industry adopts 
as well.

continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.

Thanks Martin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.</span>
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.

    Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won&#x27;t be growing at the same rate as before.
    We are between two major growth waves.
    The first one began with the global expansion of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with 
the next generation platform.
    In <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of 
the next generation vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is from Michael.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">these to produce their first products such as </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
    It&#x27;s simpler.
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> program as we steadily </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training.
    That’s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster.
    So that’s it.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And it’s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    Thank you.
    Just as a follow-up, I recognize there’s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you’re sticking with your near 
term, your volume target of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% CAGR.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution.</span>
    There’s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth.
    But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking 
differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
    Elon Musk

It’s not about getting more share.
    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.

    Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy 
business.
    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">37</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.</span>
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
    However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
    This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>$<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8.9</span> billion<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> and free cash flows of
approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.3</span> billion.
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">16</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
    That would also bring some savings from higher production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.</span>
    So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
    And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like
any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I
call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> pounds

    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the

    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.</span>
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

    So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within 
reasonable delivery time frames.
    So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
    This is a onetime thing.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, 
pricing and specifications?
    Elon Musk

Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.
    So, that’s really not an issue.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.</span>
    It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle.
    So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain 
and internal production.
    So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth.
    We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps.
    But first order approximation, there’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck.
    And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    So, it’s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, 
and we will be delivering the car this year.

    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
    The Cybertruck cell with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.

producing in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go through investor questions.
    Question number one is from Michael.
    Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline 
improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>?
    Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
    I don&#x27;t want to blow your minds, but I&#x27;m often optimistic regarding time.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    So sometime in the second half.
    That&#x27;s just what our current schedule says.
    But there&#x27;s a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
    The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the 
engineers to be living on the line.
    This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
    And it&#x27;s just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it&#x27;s in Austin versus elsewhere.
    So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the Tesla team did an incredible job in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    We achieved record production and deliveries of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
    And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> million cars a year.
    This is really a phenomenal achievement.
    Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">560</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars.
    This is a record.
    In fact, it&#x27;s the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
    And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco
Bay area.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
    There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
    We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
    So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
    Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
    We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
    So, they will impact in the near term.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">will be dealing with.</span>
    On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to 
predict precisely as to where we land.
    But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a 
daily basis.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional 
cost downs for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
    And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.
    Rod Lache

Not at this time.

    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> </span>

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.

    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.

    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.

    We will be.
    But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology 
that exists anywhere in the world.
    It&#x27;s next level.
    So it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like.
    So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially.
    So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don&#x27;t know.
    It&#x27;s hard to say what the unit volume would be next year.

    What has been the barrier to ramping <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to

commenting about that.

    And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.

Yes.
    Thanks Martin.
    As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our 
energy and services and other businesses.
    Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
    As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence 
and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">R&amp;D spend.</span>
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
