    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.

    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the same time as vehicle production?</span>
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.</span>
    And we&#x27;ll be doing Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the eastern half of North America.
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.

    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beyond Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?

    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons for Model Y.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons was the biggest cast in the world.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can start with questions in the queue.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.
    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">detail on production plans?</span>
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
    And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.

    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.</span>

    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most lending instead of selling them battery storage?</span>
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
    It&#x27;s not out of the question, but our brand is full.
    Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
    That&#x27;s not out of the question.
    Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
    And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you&#x27;ve got to store the power, stationary 
storage.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2105</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.</span>
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons for Model Y.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons was the biggest cast in the world.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.

    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s go to next question, please.
    Operator

Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
    Please go ahead.
    Gene Munster

Good evening.
    A question on Semi.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you could just walk us through the development of Megachargers, platoon and maybe just how you think about </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">autonomy for Tesla Semi?</span>
    And what is -- how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV?
    Elon Musk

Well, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    We continue the development of the Semi.
    And in particular, Megachargers, we realized that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">350</span>-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going 
to be enough for Semi.
    So we&#x27;re looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast the Semi 
as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break, yes.
    So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years?</span>
    This would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2030</span>.
    Is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">787</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

And there&#x27;s nothing more rewarding than going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> cars an hour to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a day.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.</span>
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">16</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1598</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.
    This is -- never been done before, so there&#x27;ll probably be some challenges along the way.
    And obviously, something that&#x27;s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s manufacturing challenges there.
    That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cleaner.
    Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If it goes well, we&#x27;ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next -- towards the end of next </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">year, yes.</span>
    So it&#x27;s difficult to predict.
    I would say there&#x27;s probably a lot of deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, and some deliveries towards the end of next year, if 
things go well.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And now I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
    So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it&#x27;s going to be almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">850</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units on an 
annualized basis.
    And you&#x27;re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.
    You say today you would open Austin as well.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

Congratulations on the progress.
    Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that&#x27;s going to look </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">prior to the robo taxi stage?</span>
    Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time?
    Or how do you see that playing out?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is, we&#x27;ll release more and more functionality.
    Yes, before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing.
    First, we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.
    So we run any car changes through battery tests and simulation.
    Then we have a global QA team, which I&#x27;m on, actually.

    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
    The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate 
exceeding automotive.
    Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How disruptive is Tesla&#x27;s Autobidder technology?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I can&#x27;t emphasize.
    I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
    So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
    So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector?
    Bigger than automotive.
    And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is
going to be primarily solar and followed by wind.

    While our AR balance is usually about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
    First, overall, less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
    Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain 
methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted 
significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
    Third, roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV 
incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.</span>
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
    The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units 
per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years 
beyond Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, Y and the Cybertruck?
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
