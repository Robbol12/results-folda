[Year 2021] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #24]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into **production** and with just two factories.
2. [Sentence #63]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) But we do expect to ramp Model S **production** and **start** delivering them probably next month.
3. [Sentence #64]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) So -- and then to be in sort of fairly high-volume **production** for the S in Q3 and to **start** delivering the Model X in Q3 as well.
4. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) In the background, we are continuing work -- **development** work on the Semi, **Cybertruck**, on the Roadster and other products.
5. [Sentence #355]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume **production** of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.
6. [Sentence #1110]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to **start** **production** of the $25,000 model in 2023.
7. [Sentence #1117]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be **Cybertruck**.
8. [Sentence #1138]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle **production** capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
9. [Sentence #1281]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on **Cybertruck** in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
10. [Sentence #1286]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) We've been busy detailing the **Cybertruck** to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
11. [Sentence #1613]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
12. [Sentence #1658]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, **Cybertruck**, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to **production** hopefully next year.
13. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for **Cybertruck** volume **production** besides battery shortage?
14. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in **Cybertruck** **production**.
15. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the **Cybertruck** that will take some time to work through.
16. [Sentence #1869]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I worry more about like how do we the **Cybertruck** affordable despite having awesome technology.
17. [Sentence #1871]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like **Cybertruck** to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
18. [Sentence #2035]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and **Cybertruck** in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
