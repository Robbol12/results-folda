production start in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>–<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>?

    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">receivable on the balance sheet.</span>
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
    Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car 
and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
    That&#x27;s it.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Effortless.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And many customers do that.
    Elon Musk

And they&#x27;re doing it, yes.
    In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because 
normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
    When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, 
then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or 
something on Amazon and -- except it&#x27;s a car.
    Yes.
    All right.

    Martin Viecha

The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally 
highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and time line for introduction?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Yes.</span>
    Actually, we were just -- we don&#x27;t want to preempt Battery Day.
    We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell.
    And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla&#x27;s history and we&#x27;re just trying to figure out the 
right timing for that.
    We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.
    Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that&#x27;s the right timing.
    And depending upon what we&#x27;re allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.</span>
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.

    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.

    Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> miles, but when we did the last EPA 
test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.</span>
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.

I&#x27;ll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.
    And --

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Larger, they start being called Tera.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, with multiple products as well.
    And so the absolute number of Giga factories, we may ultimately build might be less, but each one is larger.
    And that&#x27;s under our belief that just significant efficiencies by having as much as possible, and similar product 
lines under the same roof, and as much vertical integration as possible all in one facility.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can you give us an update on Solar Roof ramp?</span>
    How many are you currently able to install per week?
    What is your installations per week target for the end of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both 
from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.

    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.</span>
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.

    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> capable filter –

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">knowledge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal 
car.
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.

ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">53</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.</span>
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.</span>
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.

    I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s a fair question.
    I don&#x27;t have any additional color to provide.
    So $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8.1</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we&#x27;re managing it very closely.
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver
at the end of Q1.
    So we&#x27;re making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we&#x27;ve been looking at liquidity, we&#x27;ve been looking at this over the next </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">18</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> months, and there&#x27;s ups and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">downs to the liquidity.</span>
    Currently now, as we&#x27;re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we&#x27;re paying off.
    But then in a couple of months, we&#x27;ll quickly be through that, and then we&#x27;ll have a gap in payables since we don&#x27;t 
have any parts coming in.
    So it does go up and down a little bit.
    But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we&#x27;re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with 
the liquidity position of the company.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be 
identified as a serious risk.
    We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the 
vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and all of the Y.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It’s not like model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y – Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y also – they&#x27;re way better than any other cars to the best of my 
knowledge.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">car.</span>
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is our second large-scale product launch since Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2017</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cost control and ramp efficiency.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">increase with time.</span>
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
    The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think 
is great.
    The other one that I would add is, it&#x27;s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make 
that as digital as possible.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Touchless delivery.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
    Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Yes.</span>
    The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car 
and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
    That&#x27;s it.
    Effortless.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And many customers do that.
    Elon Musk

And they&#x27;re doing it, yes.
    In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because 
normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Soon, we will be collecting data from over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> billion intersections per month.</span>
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
    It’s the reason I say it&#x27;s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is 
training Google all the time with their searches.
    So, when you&#x27;re searching something and you click on a link, you&#x27;re training Google every time you do that.
    It&#x27;s very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.

vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and all of the Y.
    So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes 
against all their constitutional rights, that in my opinion, and breaking people&#x27;s freedoms in ways that are horrible 
and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the fuck?
    Excuse me.
    But outrage -- it’s an outrage.

    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and just despite </span>

    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.

    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">23</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">91</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.</span>
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Actually, we were just -- we don&#x27;t want to preempt Battery Day.
    We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell.
    And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla&#x27;s history and we&#x27;re just trying to figure out the 
right timing for that.
    We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.
    Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that&#x27;s the right timing.
    And depending upon what we&#x27;re allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Okay.</span>
    And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progress stores development and 
commercialization of Full Self-Driving?
    How much revenue have you recognized so far?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So there is a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving.
    And so, currently, in North America, it&#x27;s sold for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> as an option.
    We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue.
    That&#x27;s associated with features that will be released with time.
    Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">25</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">465</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we&#x27;ll have the functionality that’s really cool, also 
driving by the end of the year.
    Now after that functionality is released, there&#x27;s still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, 
once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.
    And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
    And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.
    And then presumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous 
cars that can drive with no human onboard.
    Obviously, the regulatory approval process that&#x27;s difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because it&#x27;s out of our
hands.
    But for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Gene Munster</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">So, to summarize, we want -- we&#x27;re going to give owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year.</span>
    Then a human is in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year?
    Would that be the hope?
    Elon Musk

Do you mean like, when can a car drive with no person?
    Gene Munster

With a person -- initially a person who observes, would that be with the Tesla Network app, would that be really part of
the year of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Is that the hope?
    Elon Musk

If described as a hope, I would say that, that&#x27;s probably a fair description.
    Gene Munster

Okay.

    And as a result, it had a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years?</span>
    This would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2030</span>.
    Is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">28</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It’s not like model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y – Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y also – they&#x27;re way better than any other cars to the best of my 
knowledge.
    They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal 
car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Y.</span>
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.</span>
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.

[Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">87</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">overall profitability.</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
