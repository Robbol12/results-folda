    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the same time as vehicle production?</span>
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

    There are -- yes, I think that gets at the sentiment of your question.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s go to next question, please.
    Operator

Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
    Please go ahead.
    Gene Munster

Good evening.
    A question on Semi.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you could just walk us through the development of Megachargers, platoon and maybe just how you think about </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">autonomy for Tesla Semi?</span>
    And what is -- how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV?
    Elon Musk

Well, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    We continue the development of the Semi.
    And in particular, Megachargers, we realized that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">350</span>-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going 
to be enough for Semi.
    So we&#x27;re looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast the Semi 
as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break, yes.
    So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">461</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.
    This is -- never been done before, so there&#x27;ll probably be some challenges along the way.
    And obviously, something that&#x27;s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s manufacturing challenges there.
    That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cleaner.
    Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; If it goes well, we&#x27;ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next -- towards the end of next </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">year, yes.</span>
    So it&#x27;s difficult to predict.
    I would say there&#x27;s probably a lot of deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, and some deliveries towards the end of next year, if 
things go well.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And now I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
    So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it&#x27;s going to be almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">850</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units on an 
annualized basis.
    And you&#x27;re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.
    You say today you would open Austin as well.
