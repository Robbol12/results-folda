    Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
    I don&#x27;t want to blow your minds, but I&#x27;m often optimistic regarding time.
    But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    So sometime in the second half.
    That&#x27;s just what our current schedule says.
    But there&#x27;s a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
    The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the 
engineers to be living on the line.

    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
    First, I&#x27;m wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen 
platform.
    You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and 
powertrain.
    Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
    And do you believe -- we know that there&#x27;s a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> 
volts architecture, really employing your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> batteries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don&#x27;t think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
    We&#x27;re obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
    When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
    You don&#x27;t just throw it on the line and just build it.
    So we&#x27;re going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
    Sure, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it&#x27;s something we hope the industry adopts 
as well.
    We&#x27;re also open to partnering.

    Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won&#x27;t be growing at the same rate as before.
    We are between two major growth waves.
    The first one began with the global expansion of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with 
the next generation platform.
    In <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of 
the next generation vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is from Michael.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">these to produce their first products such as </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?</span>
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.

    Question number one is from Michael.
    Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline 
improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>?

    The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the 
engineers to be living on the line.
    This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
    And it&#x27;s just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it&#x27;s in Austin versus elsewhere.
    So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the Tesla team did an incredible job in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    We achieved record production and deliveries of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
    And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> million cars a year.
    This is really a phenomenal achievement.
    Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">560</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars.
    This is a record.
    In fact, it&#x27;s the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
    And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco
Bay area.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">134</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    We will be.
    But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology 
that exists anywhere in the world.
    It&#x27;s next level.
    So it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like.
    So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially.
    So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don&#x27;t know.
    It&#x27;s hard to say what the unit volume would be next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">next year.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is from Michael again.
    What has been the barrier to ramping <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to
get there?
    Elon Musk

Karn?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I&#x27;ve seen some people 
commenting about that.
    To date, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory.
