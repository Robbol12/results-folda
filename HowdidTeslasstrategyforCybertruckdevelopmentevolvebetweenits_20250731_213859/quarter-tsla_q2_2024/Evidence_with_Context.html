    Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
    Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
    Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather 
than earnings calls.
    Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
    Our next question is, what is the current status of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
    Lars Moravy

Yes, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">51</span>% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
    We currently produce more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> Cybertrucks of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells per week, and we&#x27;ll continue to ramp output as we 
drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">a huge technical milestone and we&#x27;re super proud of that.</span>
    We&#x27;re on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly 
below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> program.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is any update on Dojo?
    Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by NVIDIA&#x27;s execution and the capability of their
hardware.
    And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it&#x27;s often difficult to get the GPUs.
    And there just seems this, I guess I&#x27;m quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs
when we want them.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand 
driver.
    And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to 
unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>V3<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>.
    We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle --
sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a 
couple of other things.
    So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the 
product unveil.
    We&#x27;re also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to
date.
    So it will be an incremental for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> H100s plus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> of our hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> AI5 Tesla AI computer.
    With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we expect to have Optimus production Version </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> in limited production starting early next year.</span>
    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> of Optimus.
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.

    But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.
    You can&#x27;t just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it&#x27;s not possible.
    So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla&#x27;s interest, not contrary to Tesla&#x27;s interest.
    Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can&#x27;t turn on.
    That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.
    We are moving the GPUs in there and we&#x27;ll bring them online.
    With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and not on Tesla&#x27;s specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.</span>
    So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not 
involved.
    Those are the two choices.
    This wasn&#x27;t they would come to Tesla.
    They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.
    So, yes.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full 
time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there&#x27;s the other spectrum of AI which we&#x27;re not working on, and that&#x27;s the 
kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
    So you have to keep that in mind that it&#x27;s a broad spectrum.

    Elon Musk

I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full 
self-driving.
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
    I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
    So next year seems highly probable to me based on  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
    That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.

    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single

    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such

    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting

    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
