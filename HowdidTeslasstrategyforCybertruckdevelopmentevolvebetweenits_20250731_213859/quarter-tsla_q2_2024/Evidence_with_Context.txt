[TSLA_Q2_2024] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023â€“2024?

1. [Sentence #123] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
     Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
     Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
     Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
     Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
     Lars Moravy

Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
     We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
>>> We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that.
     We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is any update on Dojo?
     Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware.
     And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.
     And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them.

     And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver.
     And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph).
     We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other things.
     So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil.
     We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date.
     So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer.
     With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
>>> And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year.
     This will be for Tesla consumption.
     It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
     But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories.
     And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers.
     That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus.
     For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.

3. [Sentence #208] [UNCERTAIN]
     But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.
     You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.
     So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest.
     Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on.
     That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.
     We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.
     With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
>>> So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.
     So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved.
     Those are the two choices.
     This wasn't they would come to Tesla.
     They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.
     So, yes.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
     So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum.

4. [Sentence #116] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving.
     It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
     So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
     I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
     So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
     That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.

5. [Sentence #80] [PLAN]
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
     Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
>>> Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.
     Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.
     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

     On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
     It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
