    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.</span>
    And we&#x27;ll be doing Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the eastern half of North America.
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units </span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beyond Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.
    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">detail on production plans?</span>
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
    And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;ve…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.</span>
    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.

    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

And there&#x27;s nothing more rewarding than going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> cars an hour to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a day.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.

    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
    The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate 
exceeding automotive.
    Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How disruptive is Tesla&#x27;s Autobidder technology?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I can&#x27;t emphasize.
    I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
    So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
    So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector?
    Bigger than automotive.
    And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is
going to be primarily solar and followed by wind.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">122</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
    While our AR balance is usually about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
    First, overall, less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
    Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain 
methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted 
significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
    Third, roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV 
incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.</span>
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> years.
