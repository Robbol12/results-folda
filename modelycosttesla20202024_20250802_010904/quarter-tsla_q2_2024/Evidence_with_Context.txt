     I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut.
     I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies.
     But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away?
>>> I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits.
     So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near-term?
     Why might it not be a negative?
     And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?
     Elon Musk

I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors.
     But -- and it would hurt Tesla slightly.
