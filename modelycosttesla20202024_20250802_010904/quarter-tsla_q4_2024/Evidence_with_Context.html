    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.</span>
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.

    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
    More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements

Well, right now, the constraint we&#x27;re trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And now Q1, we&#x27;ve got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.</span>
    That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
    But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we&#x27;re talking that the executive team and I were talking about just 
before this call was we&#x27;ve got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one 
way or another.
    That&#x27;s the constraint on our output.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    All right.
    And with that, I think we are all done for today.
    So, thanks, everyone, so much for all your questions.

    And I think probably with Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, it is a very rough guess because there&#x27;s so much uncertainty here, very rough 
guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next 
year, something like that.
    But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one&#x27;s receiving humanoid robots to these 
things like coming out like crazy.
    We can&#x27;t build enough.
    We&#x27;re always going to be in the -- we can&#x27;t build enough situation.
    Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.</span>
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.

    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
