1. [Sentence #14] [UNCERTAIN]
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year.

That's worth noting.
     Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, No.
     1 was Model Y.
     We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don't know what -- really, I was going to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing frankly.
     Doubling is not even enough.

2. [Sentence #177] [PLAN]
     Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
     This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which impacted ASPs.
     While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market.
     This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
     On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
     Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, driven primarily by material costs.
     This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
>>> All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
     While we feel confident in our team's abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change, and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time.
     This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
     As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch but will be overcome as production is ramped.
     We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025.
     We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there.
     From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get better from here.
     As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full autonomy in the future.

3. [Sentence #585] [PILOT]
     We have a lot of cars.
     I mean, you've got millions of cars out there.
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
     Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
     More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
>>> And now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.
     That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
     But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we're talking that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call was we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another.
     That's the constraint on our output.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     All right.
     And with that, I think we are all done for today.
     So, thanks, everyone, so much for all your questions.

4. [Sentence #297] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And I think probably with Version 2, it is a very rough guess because there's so much uncertainty here, very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that.
     But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one's receiving humanoid robots to these things like coming out like crazy.
     We can't build enough.
     We're always going to be in the -- we can't build enough situation.
     Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
     And then I said like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- I'm confident at 1 million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000.
     If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car.
>>> So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over 1 million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that.
     What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
     The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?
     And how will it impact revenue and scale?
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.

5. [Sentence #176] [PLAN]
     For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who helped us achieve this.
     Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.

     Doubling is not even enough.
     We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing, AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense.
     Like it's, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.
     And I've said this before and I'll stand by it.
     I see a path.
     I'm not saying it's an easy path but I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far.

7. [Sentence #155] [UNCERTAIN]
     This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as much demand as we can possibly make.
     So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation, and we're building a third factory.
     So, we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
     Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from 1 pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications?
     It can't go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
     But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time.
     So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
>>> And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y.
     In fact, I think it probably will be viewed '25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.
     There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
     I don't even know who's in second place.
     Like you say, like, who's in the second place for real-world AI?
     I would need a very big telescope to see them.
     That's how far behind they are.
     All right.
