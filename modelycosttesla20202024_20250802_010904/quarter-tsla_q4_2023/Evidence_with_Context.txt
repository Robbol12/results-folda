[TSLA_Q4_2023] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #28] [PLAN]
     And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
     What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
     Think about that.
     It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
     And it's enriched the community in so many different ways.
     It's really a gem.
     So I'm super proud of the people that work there.
>>> Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
     The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units delivered.
     The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before.
     So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
     And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.

2. [Sentence #416] [UNCERTAIN]
     Andrew Baglino

And it's a growing pie as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Exactly

Andrew Baglino

It's like its 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or in the future.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     Andrew Baglino

Certainly, like the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how many EVs we sell.
     It's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell.
     And that market is 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that.
     I still think there's 98% more to get.
>>> Elon Musk

I mean, it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than a Model Y.

Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
     Elon Musk

So like Toyota RAV4.
     Andrew Baglino

Corolla.
     Elon Musk

Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing.
     They're much lower priced than ours.
     So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla.
     It's quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it's the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.

3. [Sentence #223] [PLAN]
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.
     Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly.
     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
>>> And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
     Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
     And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet.
     I think that will become obvious probably this year.
     And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology.

4. [Sentence #221] [PLAN]
     When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
     Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.
     Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
