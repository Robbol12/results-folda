    On a full year basis: revenue increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, and 
our margins remained industry-leading.
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">premium to Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">27</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
    So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ve actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.</span>
    So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">700</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> per long-range Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">45</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?</span>
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
