[TSLA_Q2_2021] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #27] [UNCERTAIN]
     So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
     So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
     In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
     The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
     It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
     For Model 3 to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
     In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
>>> When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year.
     So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
     I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
     Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
     This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever existed.
     And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, simply real-world artificial intelligence.
     And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 watts or 80 watts.
     So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that.

     This has got to fit into a smaller screen.
     And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we are finally getting rid of one of the last questions.

3. [Sentence #75] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
>>> And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
     In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Thanks, Elon.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of 2021, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
>>> First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
     For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition.
     And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
     Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities.
     While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
     We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.

     One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction related to Powertrain.
     But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle.
     So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
     Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
     Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
>>> Model 3 and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.
     But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much 60%.
     And the part costs money.
     So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
     When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
     So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be integrated into that.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.

     You had to retrofit that to your need.

7. [Sentence #113] [PLAN]
     And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
     Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from SNX.
     Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt.
     We also invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 financials.
     Taking a step back, we have generated $8 billion in operating cash flows and $4 billion in free cash flows over the past four quarters.
     As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of 50% annually and we believe we are on track to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter.
     Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels, and so we are driving as fast as we can to increase our production rates.
>>> As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on SNX, as we have discussed, continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs, and we expect profitability and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.
     And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest factories in Austin and Berlin.
     So there’s certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to.
     Thank you and we will open it up for questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And we will first take a retail questions from, say, our website.
     The first question is, how is how is Dojo coming along?
     Could Dojo unlock an AWS-like business line for Tesla over the next few years?
