    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">probably, next year.</span>
    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.
    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span> watts or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span> watts.
    So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> computers in a server room or something like

    This has got to fit into a smaller screen.
    And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we are finally getting rid of one of the last questions.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other 
products.
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

    Zachary Kirkhorn

    Thanks, Martin.
    Thanks, Elon.
    So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, as Elon had 
mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.</span>
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">501</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    You had to retrofit that to your need.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
    Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant
working capital headwinds from SNX.
    Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt.
    We also invested $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%, which contributed to 
a small gain in our Q1 financials.
    Taking a step back, we have generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span> billion in operating cash flows and $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> billion in free cash flows over the 
past four quarters.
    As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annually and we believe we are on track 
to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter.
    Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels, and so we are driving as fast as we can to 
increase our production rates.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on SNX, as we have discussed, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs, and we expect profitability </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.</span>
    And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest 
factories in Austin and Berlin.
    So there’s certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to.
    Thank you and we will open it up for questions.

Thank you very much.
    And we will first take a retail questions from, say, our website.
    The first question is, how is how is Dojo coming along?
    Could Dojo unlock an AWS-like business line for Tesla over the next few years?
