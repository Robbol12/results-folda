[TSLA_Q2_2020] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #450] [UNCERTAIN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.
     We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
     The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
     So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
     Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
     And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
>>> And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
     They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
     And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
     And it's continuing to do more and more internally.
     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

2. [Sentence #354] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
     What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume production later this year.
     So, we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
     And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
     So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
     We use very little cobalt in our system already and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y.
     No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
     Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
     What are the biggest constraints now?
     Elon Musk

Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
     Okay.
     Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
     As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.

     Thank you.

4. [Sentence #101] [UNCERTAIN]
     On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
     This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world.
     To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects.
     The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions.
     Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
     On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
     This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the various shutdowns.
>>> Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
     With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
     The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
     Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
     While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
     Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
     In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.

     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
     And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.

     Zach Kirkhorn

There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.

7. [Sentence #200] [UNCERTAIN]
     There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factory then for the product itself.
     So we're certainly making progress.
     I mean, battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, you know, alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that, starting to approach version 1.
     We're getting way better at making cars.
     You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
     You'll see that even more with Berlin.
     And we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.
>>> The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date.
     Drew, would you like to add to that?
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
     I was going to expand on that.
     I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit.
     And we're learning so much through doing that.
     Elon Musk

Vertical integration is extremely important to this.
     But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane.
