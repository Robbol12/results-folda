    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
    We&#x27;re going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth rate.

    Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We&#x27;re continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial 
metrics for Q3.
    Overall, we delivered just over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">240</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% higher than the same quarter 
last year.
    We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million cars towards the end of the 
quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.</span>
    Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to 
ramp and deliveries of Model X.
    It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
    This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.

    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for 
the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>?

    I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive 
flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
    These teams&#x27; expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these 
challenges.
    Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we&#x27;re adding capacity as quickly as 
possible.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.

    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.
    The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our 
existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
    Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack 
production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
    Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
    And we&#x27;re excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
    Financially, our auto gross margins reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30.5</span>% on a GAAP basis and just under <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span>%, excluding regulatory credits, 
which was our strongest yet.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.</span>
    The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the 
ramp of Model X.
    As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
    However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
    Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our 
financials.
    Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.
    Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this 
quarter.
    While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which
should help to compensate.

    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.

    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible there.
    Over the last <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months, we&#x27;ve done about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">430</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars of production.
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.</span>
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and

    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.

Thank you very much.
    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Y production in Fremont and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Shanghai.</span>
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">109</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.</span>
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
    And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
