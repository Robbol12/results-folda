[TSLA_Q3_2021] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #111] [PLAN]
     And they're going to continue to push on that.
     As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there as well.
     So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
     We'll continue to ramp that factory.
     And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
     Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
     But we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.
>>> And so, we'll take Model Y at these factories.
     We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.
     And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.
     And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
     So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
     And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.
     We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.
     Martin Viecha

Great.

2. [Sentence #15] [PLAN]
     [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks.
     Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We're continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3.
     Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter, and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.
     We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.
>>> The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
     Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to ramp and deliveries of Model X.
     It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
     But based on demand, we're targeting to exceed historical production levels.
     We've also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
     This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
     Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
     It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.

3. [Sentence #87] [PLAN]
     The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster iteration.
     So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is, "Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet will be necessary to achieve 20 million in annual volumes?
     The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over 1 million units, so is it possible to achieve 20 million units with just S, X, 3, Y, truck and the $25,000 car?"
     Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
     As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
>>> As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
     Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
     As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
     Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.

4. [Sentence #20] [PLAN]

     I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
     These teams' expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these challenges.
     Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.

5. [Sentence #71] [PLAN]
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
     I think Zach spoke to that well.
     And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
     We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.
     While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
>>> As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
     And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
     Lars Moravy

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
     This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
     In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
     If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.

6. [Sentence #33] [PLAN]
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.
     The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
     Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
     Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
     And we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
     Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29%, excluding regulatory credits, which was our strongest yet.
>>> This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
     The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.
     As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
     However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
     Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials.
     Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.
     Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this quarter.
     While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate.

7. [Sentence #86] [PLAN]
     But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
     The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster iteration.
     So daily updates are not really realistic for now.

     But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
     In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there.
     Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production.
     And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re targeting to increase that another 50%.
     I think that will be a difficult goal, but that's the goal that the internal team has.
     And they're going to continue to push on that.
     As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there as well.
