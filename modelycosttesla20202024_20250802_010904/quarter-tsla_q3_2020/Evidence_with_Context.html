    Or was there also FSD revenues?
    Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
    It&#x27;s not particularly material in the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million range for the quarter.
    With respect to product margins, what we&#x27;re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really 
across every product.
    Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.</span>
    But we&#x27;ve guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> built in Fremont costs.
    It&#x27;s not quite there, and it&#x27;s also a bit of a moving target as Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to
come down with that.
    But we&#x27;re generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
    And not too far off of this, we&#x27;re seeing strength in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Fremont and S and X margins.
    So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.

Great.

    And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
    And I think your strategy generally has been, you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate 
the extra volume.

    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
    In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and 
Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Capital expenses grew to $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.</span>
    As were previous investments in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
