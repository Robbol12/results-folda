[TSLA_Q2_2022] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #226] [PLAN]
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean, you might need to create a new alloy, then you need to figure out how to cast it, then you need to ramp the casting machine with the new alloy, as an example…

Elon Musk

We did.
     Lars Moravy

We have done it for rudders.
     We’ve done it for like castings.
     So, like yes, it does take time.
     Andrew Baglino

Constant improvement is something we are used to here, and it’s something like we’ve done with their vehicles and our design since the beginning.
     I mean, even we’re talking a couple of weeks ago, like the first version of the front casting that we made that went into the early vehicles is like...

Elon Musk

I mean Model S stage.
>>> Andrew Baglino

No, I am talking about like our first Model Ys.
     Since we have ordered more dies because bringing more dies for more production, we’ve saved like 4 or 5 kilos of mass just doing die iteration.
     And that’s something we do at Tesla like quite regularly and we will continue to do.
     So we’re not happy with a C, like maybe we are at a C+ now because I think we got to keep going to the tag of B-.
     Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
     But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
     So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done in the past where you’ve got 120 different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
     So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact that there’s a casting.
