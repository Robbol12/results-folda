    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

    On a full year basis: revenue increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, and 
our margins remained industry-leading.
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">premium to Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3190</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
    What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive 
coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total 
vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron 
phosphate battery pack in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> Range version of Model Y.</span>
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
    Elon Musk

Well, I&#x27;d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
    Okay.
    Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don&#x27;t wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some 
high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
    As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.

    Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another – a bunch of other companies to put in 
place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.
    We’re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great.
    Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless.
    So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it’s about the same size and magnitude as
the IRA benefits that we also received.
    Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there’s two things to 
keep in mind there.
    The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2.
    So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it’s important to adjust for that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere.</span>
    And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased.
    And so, that’s something to consider as you model out the impact on – from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.
    I do want to ask Karn if there’s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yes.
    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
    So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ve actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.</span>
    So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.9</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
    Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, 
these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.
    In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved 
slightly.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.</span>
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24.6</span>%.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.</span>
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.

    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.

    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.

    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">700</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> per long-range Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">45</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>

    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.

    And it&#x27;s really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
    What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.
    It&#x27;s really a gem.
    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.</span>
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.2</span> million units delivered.
    The energy storage business delivered nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> gigawatt hours of batteries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.5</span> gigawatt hours 
the year before.
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.

    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.</span>
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
    And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cost structure will converge.
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.

two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved </span>

    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.

    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
    We&#x27;re going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth rate.

    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
    But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico 
factory.
    I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in.
    I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.
    And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.
    So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they 
simply cannot afford it.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">revenue, but in unit volume.</span>
    If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than
our car.
    So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
    I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
    I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.

    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
    More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements 
on FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we&#x27;re trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And now Q1, we&#x27;ve got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.</span>
    That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
    But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we&#x27;re talking that the executive team and I were talking about just 
before this call was we&#x27;ve got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one 
way or another.
    That&#x27;s the constraint on our output.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    All right.
    And with that, I think we are all done for today.

    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">23</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.</span>
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.

    And I think probably with Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, it is a very rough guess because there&#x27;s so much uncertainty here, very rough 
guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next 
year, something like that.
    But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one&#x27;s receiving humanoid robots to these 
things like coming out like crazy.
    We can&#x27;t build enough.
    We&#x27;re always going to be in the -- we can&#x27;t build enough situation.
    Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.</span>
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.

    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">ahead of schedule.</span>
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> But before we jump into the Q&amp;A, Zach has some opening remarks.
    Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We&#x27;re continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial 
metrics for Q3.
    Overall, we delivered just over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">240</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% higher than the same quarter 
last year.
    We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million cars towards the end of the 
quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.</span>
    Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to 
ramp and deliveries of Model X.
    It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
    This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.</span>
    We ramped the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai to more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow 
rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">30</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> 
million units with just S, X, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, Y, truck and the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car?&quot;
    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.</span>
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for 
the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
