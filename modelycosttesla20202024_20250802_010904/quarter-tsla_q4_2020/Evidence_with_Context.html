    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.</span>
    We ramped the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai to more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow 
rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.

    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
    Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we&#x27;re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X
are in production now and will be delivered in February.
    So we&#x27;ve been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
    And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
    The Model S Plaid, and we&#x27;re actually in production now, and we&#x27;ll be delivering next month.

    Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million of interest expense 
for the quarter.
    All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain 
industry leading.
    As we look forward, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> may be our most meaningful step forward yet, as we see the benefits of long-standing 
investments in capacity and technology.
    The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches.
    That&#x27;s a few things we should keep in mind.
    We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, of which we may materially exceed this in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>.
    As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will
be a part of this year&#x27;s story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.</span>
    Additionally, we&#x27;re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port 
capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
    We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including
OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    Global demand continues to outpace production, and we&#x27;re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
    I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can jump straight into questions from <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Safe<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>  Technologies.
    The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share
leader in solar?
