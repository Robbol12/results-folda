3. [Sentence #600]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And ****Model** Y** became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf.
4. [Sentence #741]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin **cost**, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above ****Model** Y** production costs elsewhere.
5. [Sentence #787]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the ****Model** Y**, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from **Model** 3, it’s 10 times cheaper and 3 times faster to do it with the cast rail.

10. [Sentence #1660]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) ****Model** Y** became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
11. [Sentence #1853]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) And then ****Model** Y** was somewhat of a variant on **Model** 3.
12. [Sentence #1855]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the ****Model** Y** production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
13. [Sentence #2048]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Elon Musk
