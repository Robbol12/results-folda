    Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another – a bunch of other companies to put in 
place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.
    We’re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great.
    Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless.
    So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it’s about the same size and magnitude as
the IRA benefits that we also received.
    Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there’s two things to 
keep in mind there.
    The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2.
    So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it’s important to adjust for that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere.</span>
    And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased.
    And so, that’s something to consider as you model out the impact on – from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.
    I do want to ask Karn if there’s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yes.
    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.

    And it&#x27;s really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
    What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.
    It&#x27;s really a gem.
    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.</span>
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.2</span> million units delivered.
    The energy storage business delivered nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> gigawatt hours of batteries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.5</span> gigawatt hours 
the year before.
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.

    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
    But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico 
factory.
    I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in.
    I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.
    And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.
    So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they 
simply cannot afford it.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">revenue, but in unit volume.</span>
    If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than
our car.
    So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
    I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
    I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So, just a Q2 recap.
    In Q2 we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span> billion in a single 
quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And Model Y became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf.</span>
    So, it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price.
    This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their 
support.
    And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty.
    And nonetheless, we managed to achieve operating margin of about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    We continue to target <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.8</span> million vehicle deliveries this year.
    Although, we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we’ve got summer shutdowns to -- for a lot 
of factory upgrades.
    So, just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades.

    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    Andrew Baglino

Certainly, like the way we&#x27;ve looked at it, and we&#x27;ve always said this, it&#x27;s not about how many EVs we sell.
    It&#x27;s how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell.
    And that market is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million a year, and we&#x27;re barely <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>% of that.
    I still think there&#x27;s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">98</span>% more to get.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">I mean, it&#x27;s worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the </span>

    Andrew Baglino

Corolla.
    Elon Musk

Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing.
    They&#x27;re much lower priced than ours.
    So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla.
    It&#x27;s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it&#x27;s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite 
being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.

    Texas is now our primary <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility.

    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the

    The next question from institutional investors.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So a much easier situation.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.</span>
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
    Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.

    So just a Q1 recap.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">States.</span>
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.

approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.3</span> billion.
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Model Y for as low as $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">399</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a month.</span>
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
    How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of 
these to produce their first products such as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.
    Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y 
ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that I mean, Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> production was three years of hell, I&#x27;ve said it before, some of 
the really worst years of my life, frankly.
    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    So a much easier situation.
    And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly 
improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
    Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It’s like what are you talking about, you -- I mean, how detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to
be?
    While they take advantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home.
    So, I mean, you have to say like why did I sleep in the factory so many times, because it mattered.
    So I just can’t emphasize again how important cost is.
    It’s not an optional thing for most people, it is a necessary thing.
    We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it.
    And I keep harping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, we’re looking an internal analysis, which we think is more or less on track that when you look at the cost </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">-- or the price reductions we’ve made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people’s monthly payment has</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.</span>
    Vaibhav Taneja

If you factor in the<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes, which is what I’m trying to say.
    The thing that matters is the monthly -- it’s how much money do they have to put down and do they literally have 
that in their bank account or their check balance and then what is the monthly payment.
    And it doesn’t matter how -- if that monthly payment is principal interest or whatever, it’s just a number, and that
number has to not cause their bank account to go negative.
    That’s it.
    So going from near zero interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment 
is basically the same.
    It’s just a bunch more of it is going to interest.
    And there are some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has 
increased.

    There’s a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and 
multiple joining methods.
    Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out.
    Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled out.
    Dried adhesive has to be removed, stains, cut, blah, blah, blah.
    Elon Musk

It’s a crazy patch of a quilt.
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    And so putting that back together means time and money.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from </span>

    Design team works with our collision repair team since we’re a closed loop on this with insurance, and we design 
specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair.
    And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops.
    We expect that we’ll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time.
    And we already make this available to all body shops or our Tesla-approved body shop training.
    Elon Musk

Yes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.
    Lars Moravy

Crucial.
    I don’t think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, I guess in which ways would you monetize it?
    Elon Musk

Sorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing because that&#x27;s sort of like a generic term for our 
next-generation vehicle.
    And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle.
    That&#x27;s going to be very compelling.
    This is just not the time to talk about it in details product.
    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, there will be a like a Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.</span>
    So, yes, that&#x27;s -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
    And then maybe a question for Zach.
    Back on the automotive gross margins.
    So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive 
gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
