    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, that is just unvarnished, our internal estimate.
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yes.
    Yeah.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, that&#x27;s not sandbagging or anything else.
    Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements 
thereafter.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.</span>
    So, you don&#x27;t expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
    A Cybercab looks different.
    A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> are -- look, they&#x27;re good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
    You don&#x27;t expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it 
does.
    So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we&#x27;re doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in 
the software, we&#x27;ll roll out another sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
    And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.
    So, the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> event.

    But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the 
initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that&#x27;s really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI 
road map.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    It will be like with incentive.
    So, 30K, which is kind of a key threshold.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.

Yeah, all our vehicles today are --

So, I think we&#x27;ve made very clear that we&#x27;re -- the future is autonomous.
    I mean, it&#x27;s going to be -- I&#x27;ve actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that 
is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles.
    And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone.
    It&#x27;s not that there are no horses.
    Yes, there are some but they&#x27;re unusual.
    They&#x27;re niche.
    And so, everything is going to be electric autonomous.
