--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  In Q1, we produced more **Model** Ys in the first quarter than **Model** 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
2. [Sentence #24]  Thus far, the ****Model** Y** ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
3. [Sentence #26]  Most surprisingly, ****Model** Y** was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
4. [Sentence #56]  For ****Model** Y**, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
5. [Sentence #57]  So ****Model** Y** has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the **Model** 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
6. [Sentence #75]  We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the ****Model** Y**, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
7. [Sentence #95]  ****Model** Y** in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for ****Model** Y** in Fremont and **Model** 3 in Shanghai.
8. [Sentence #100]  Note that one of the most important aspects of ****Model** Y** in Fremont and **Model** 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
9. [Sentence #391]  But for a five-seater ****Model** Y**, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the **Model** 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].
10. [Sentence #508]  ****Model** Y** ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
