    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.9</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
    Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, 
these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.
    In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved 
slightly.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.</span>
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24.6</span>%.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.</span>
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.

    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
    More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements 
on FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we&#x27;re trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And now Q1, we&#x27;ve got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.</span>
    That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
    But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we&#x27;re talking that the executive team and I were talking about just 
before this call was we&#x27;ve got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one 
way or another.
    That&#x27;s the constraint on our output.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    All right.
    And with that, I think we are all done for today.
    So, thanks, everyone, so much for all your questions.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And I think probably with Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, it is a very rough guess because there&#x27;s so much uncertainty here, very rough 
guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next 
year, something like that.
    But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one&#x27;s receiving humanoid robots to these 
things like coming out like crazy.
    We can&#x27;t build enough.
    We&#x27;re always going to be in the -- we can&#x27;t build enough situation.
    Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.</span>
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?
    And how will it impact revenue and scale?

I can take that one.

    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, that is just unvarnished, our internal estimate.
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yes.
    Yeah.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, that&#x27;s not sandbagging or anything else.
    Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements 
thereafter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.</span>
    So, you don&#x27;t expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
    A Cybercab looks different.
    A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> are -- look, they&#x27;re good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
    You don&#x27;t expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it 
does.
    So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we&#x27;re doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in 
the software, we&#x27;ll roll out another sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
    And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.
    So, the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> event.

That&#x27;s worth noting.

    We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don&#x27;t know what -- really, I was going
to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it&#x27;s like autonomy is like 1<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span>-ing frankly.
    Doubling is not even enough.
    We made many critical investments in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> in manufacturing, AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the 
future, immense.
    Like it&#x27;s, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.
    And I&#x27;ve said this before and I&#x27;ll stand by it.
    I see a path.
    I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s an easy path but I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when we look back on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> or Model Y.</span>
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.
    All right.

    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    It’s just – if you’ve got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot delivered to people.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if you’ve got the excess demand for Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y in one market, but you don’t have it there.</span>
    It’s quite a – it’s extremely complex logistics situation.
    So, I’d say also the – we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we’ve just in the past week or so have greatly
simplified.
    So, it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute.
    So, we’re getting back to that you can buy a Tesla in under a minute interface from what was quite complex.

Yes.
    Sorry.
    I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there&#x27;s a higher chance that IRA could get cut.
    I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn&#x27;t survive on EV subsidies.
    But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits.</span>
    So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the 
near-term?
    Why might it not be a negative?
    And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?
    Elon Musk

I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors.
    But -- and it would hurt Tesla slightly.
    But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess.
    Yes -- but I&#x27;ve said this before on earnings calls, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy.

    But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the 
initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that&#x27;s really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI 
road map.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    It will be like with incentive.

So, I think we&#x27;ve made very clear that we&#x27;re -- the future is autonomous.
    I mean, it&#x27;s going to be -- I&#x27;ve actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that 
is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles.
    And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone.
    It&#x27;s not that there are no horses.
    Yes, there are some but they&#x27;re unusual.
    They&#x27;re niche.
    And so, everything is going to be electric autonomous.
