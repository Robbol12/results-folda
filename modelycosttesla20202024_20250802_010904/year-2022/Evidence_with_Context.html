    On a full year basis: revenue increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, and 
our margins remained industry-leading.
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">premium to Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1710</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, it&#x27;s worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> credit to the team for achieving that.
    The most common question we&#x27;ve been getting from investors is about demand.
    Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest.
    Thus far in January, we&#x27;ve seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history.
    We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production.
    So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ve actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.</span>
    So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole.
    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.

    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">700</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> per long-range Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">45</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?</span>
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.

    Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials as we make progress delivering cars and our growing 
backlog.
    Note that, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long.
    Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being 
ordered today.
    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.</span>
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we don’t want to get complacent or entitled, but this should be a faster ramp because we have learned more, </span>

    And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
    As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
    So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> for Tesla Semi in North 
America.
    And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
    And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.</span>

Thank you.
    The next question is, what is the progress of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell ramp?
    And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells?
    And how will that change in the next year?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
    Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car cells per week this 
quarter, as we said last quarter.
    Our focus is now shifting from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon
also mentioned.

    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
    And how do you balance the need for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>?
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.

Yes.

    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, you might need to create a new alloy, then you need to figure out how to cast it, then you need to ramp the 
casting machine with the new alloy, as an example…

Elon Musk

We did.
    Lars Moravy

We have done it for rudders.
    We’ve done it for like castings.
    So, like yes, it does take time.
    Andrew Baglino

Constant improvement is something we are used to here, and it’s something like we’ve done with their vehicles and our 
design since the beginning.
    I mean, even we’re talking a couple of weeks ago, like the first version of the front casting that we made that went
into the early vehicles is like<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

I mean Model S stage.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">No, I am talking about like our first Model Ys.</span>
    Since we have ordered more dies because bringing more dies for more production, we’ve saved like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> kilos of 
mass just doing die iteration.
    And that’s something we do at Tesla like quite regularly and we will continue to do.
    So we’re not happy with a C, like maybe we are at a C+ now because I think we got to keep going to the tag of B-.
    Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
    But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
    So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done 
in the past where you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">120</span> different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and 
then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
    So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the 
master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact 
that there’s a casting.
