[TSLA_Q3_2022] model-y cost tesla 2020-2024

1. [Sentence #514] [PLAN]
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
     And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
>>> We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
     10,000 miles.
     Elon Musk

10,000 miles.
     Pretty good.
     Unidentified Company Representative

No problems yet.

Before incentive.

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.

4. [Sentence #203] [PLAN]
     It’s [indiscernible] table.
     You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
     And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
     As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
     So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.
     And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
     And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
>>> So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?
     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
     Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter.
     Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.
