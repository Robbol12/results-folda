    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">probably, next year.</span>
    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.
    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span> watts or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span> watts.

    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
    We&#x27;re going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth rate.

    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other 
products.
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We&#x27;re continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial 
metrics for Q3.
    Overall, we delivered just over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">240</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% higher than the same quarter 
last year.
    We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million cars towards the end of the 
quarter.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.</span>
    Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to 
ramp and deliveries of Model X.
    It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
    This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>

    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.</span>
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for

    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.</span>
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.
    I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive 
flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
    These teams&#x27; expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these 
challenges.
    Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we&#x27;re adding capacity as quickly as 
possible.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.

    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.</span>
    And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.
    The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our 
existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
    Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack 
production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
    Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
    And we&#x27;re excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
    Financially, our auto gross margins reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30.5</span>% on a GAAP basis and just under <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span>%, excluding regulatory credits, 
which was our strongest yet.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.</span>
    The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the 
ramp of Model X.
    As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
    However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
    Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our 
financials.
    Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.
    Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this 
quarter.
    While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which
should help to compensate.

    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Thanks, Elon.
    So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, as Elon had 
mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.</span>
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Lastly, thanks to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span> billion of GAAP net income in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the 
Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
    This is a critical milestone for the Company.
    So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
    So, we&#x27;ve begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
    But that&#x27;s not the most important thing.
    We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
    But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we&#x27;ve been making quite a few cars in 
Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in Texas, we&#x27;re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cells, and we’ll start </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.</span>
    Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new 
locations in the future.
    Although we&#x27;re not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, look at new locations
and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
    In <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
    So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
    And yes, so that&#x27;s -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
    And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I&#x27;m not sure what you do
for an encore to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, comfortably above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.

    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.

    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for 
the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible there.
    Over the last <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months, we&#x27;ve done about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">430</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars of production.
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.</span>
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
    And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.

    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.

Thank you very much.
    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and Y production in Fremont and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Shanghai.</span>
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">18</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
    Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">60</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
    You had to retrofit that to your need.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
    Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant
working capital headwinds from SNX.
    Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt.
    We also invested $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%, which contributed to 
a small gain in our Q1 financials.
    Taking a step back, we have generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span> billion in operating cash flows and $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> billion in free cash flows over the 
past four quarters.
    As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annually and we believe we are on track 
to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter.
    Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels, and so we are driving as fast as we can to 
increase our production rates.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quarters should largely be driven by execution on SNX, as we have discussed, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">continued ramp of Model Y in Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs, and we expect profitability </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and cash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.</span>
    And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp of our newest 
factories in Austin and Berlin.
    So there’s certainly no shortage of exciting things for us to work on and look forward to.
    Thank you and we will open it up for questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And we will first take a retail questions from, say, our website.
    The first question is, how is how is Dojo coming along?
    Could Dojo unlock an AWS-like business line for Tesla over the next few years?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1155</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2021]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.</span>
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
    And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
