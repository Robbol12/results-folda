Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.

    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.

    Lastly, thanks to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span> billion of GAAP net income in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the 
Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
    This is a critical milestone for the Company.
    So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
    So, we&#x27;ve begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
    But that&#x27;s not the most important thing.
    We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
    But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we&#x27;ve been making quite a few cars in 
Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in Texas, we&#x27;re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cells, and we’ll start </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.</span>
    Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new 
locations in the future.
    Although we&#x27;re not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, look at new locations
and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
    In <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
    So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
    And yes, so that&#x27;s -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
    And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I&#x27;m not sure what you do
for an encore to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, comfortably above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
