[Year 2025] tariffs; revenue; competition

1. [Sentence #833, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     That's the second question.
     And as we said, we -- I would be guiding orders, and that's not what we do.
     And it was the second question.
     Be patient with me.

We now have a question from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.
     Christopher M. Snyder

I wanted to ask on gross margin.
     We have obviously come under some pressure here in the first half, after a period of very healthy expansion.
>>> Is this only a function of tariffs and some of the inefficiencies discussed earlier?
     Or are there also headwinds from whether it be mix or new technologies ramping, i.e.
     liquid cooling?
     When you guys look at the backlog, is the expectation that gross margin return to expansion in Q4 and that kind of helps provide that operating lift?
     Or is that still a little bit further out?
     Giordano Albertazzi

A couple of things I'd be pleased to add.
     We are happy about the new technologies, and I think the new technologies corroborate our value story and certainly our margin story.
     As we explained, there is -- there are tariff elements and, certainly, growth, inefficiency in the operational aspects that we, I think, have discussed.
