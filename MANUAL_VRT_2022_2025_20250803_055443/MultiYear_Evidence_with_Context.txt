[Multi-Year Analysis] tariffs; revenue; competition

1. [Sentence #7112, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     That's the second question.
     And as we said, we -- I would be guiding orders, and that's not what we do.
     And it was the second question.
     Be patient with me.
     Operator

We now have a question from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.
     Christopher M. Snyder

I wanted to ask on gross margin.
     We have obviously come under some pressure here in the first half, after a period of very healthy expansion.
>>> Is this only a function of tariffs and some of the inefficiencies discussed earlier?
     Or are there also headwinds from whether it be mix or new technologies ramping, i.e.
     liquid cooling?
     When you guys look at the backlog, is the expectation that gross margin return to expansion in Q4 and that kind of helps provide that operating lift?
     Or is that still a little bit further out?
     Giordano Albertazzi

A couple of things I'd be pleased to add.
     We are happy about the new technologies, and I think the new technologies corroborate our value story and certainly our margin story.
     As we explained, there is -- there are tariff elements and, certainly, growth, inefficiency in the operational aspects that we, I think, have discussed.
-----
2. [Sentence #6963, VRT_Q2_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     There was an aspect about diversity.
     I'd say that clearly, if we think about the part of the market that grows the fastest, we're certainly thinking what the -- what we call the call it hyperscale.
     And you know that is quite a large container for us.
     That includes certainly hyperscale, traditional colocation, sovereign and definitely neocloud.
     So it's well balanced in that respect.
     Operator

We now have Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
     Jeffrey Todd Sprague

I'm going to sneak an unrelated two-parter in here too, if I can.
>>> Just first on tariffs and inflation.
     Just given this kind of remarkable demand pulse you're seeing, do you have kind of the commercial leverage to fully recover tariffs?
     We're just talking about some kind of delay in terms of moving through the order backlog and converting to sales.
     And then I'm sorry, Gio, could you just maybe address, a little scare through the market a couple of weeks ago on AWS delivering some kind of -- or developing some kind of liquid cooling application.
     How you put something like that in context to your business?
     Giordano Albertazzi

Well, I really have a hard time, Jeff, reconciling these 2 questions into one.
     So let me start from the AWS one.
     So in general, think in terms of hyperscalers having certainly a very strong opinion on how they want their infrastructure to be.

3. [Sentence #6780, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     Q2 orders were up approximately 15% from Q2 '24, and certainly not an easy comp, and up 11% sequentially from 1Q '25.
     Our trailing 12-month organic orders growth was 11%.
     Our Q2 book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x is particularly encouraging.
     We continue to build backlog at very high levels.
     Momentum in our business is accelerating.
     Our Q2 adjusted operating profit was $489 million, up 28% year-on-year, driven by higher sales.
     Our adjusted operating margin of 18.5%, in line with guidance, is approximately 110 basis points lower than prior year.
>>> This was primarily driven by the net impact of tariffs.
     Our updated guidance takes into consideration tariffs active on the 28 of July, reflecting a moderate improvement in the tariff situation compared to our Q1 guidance.
     The temporary costs of the supply chain and manufacturing transition to tariff-optimized footprint are higher than we initially estimated.
     We're also experiencing some temporary costs to deliver a steeper growth than expected and some executional challenges in EMEA.
     We expect all these factors will significantly moderate during the year, and we believe they will be materially resolved by year-end.
     For Q3 and for the full year, we are raising our investment in ER&D and in growth compared to prior guidance.
     Our second quarter free cash flow of $277 million, though lower on a year-on-year basis, corroborates a strong cash generation trend, with adjusted free cash flow of $542 million in the first half, a robust growth of 24% year-on-year.
     This performance was driven by our improved operational execution, resulting in higher adjusting operating profit.

     Now no 2 hyperscalers have the same behaviors.

5. [Sentence #6451, VRT_Q1_2025] [PLAN]
     First, we are increasing full year sales guidance by $250 million, including approximately $150 million organically and approximately $100 million from favorable foreign exchange.
     The $150 million increase in organic sales is driven by both the first quarter and higher expectations in the second quarter versus what was implied in our prior guidance.
     Regionally, we are increasing full year expectations for both the Americas and APAC, while lowering projections for EMEA.
     Full year organic sales growth is now expected to be 18% at the midpoint, 2 percentage points higher than our prior guidance.
     We are maintaining our full year guidance for adjusted operating profit at $1.935 billion at the midpoint.
     This guidance assumes that tariff rates in effect yesterday remain in effect for the remainder of the year.
     Of course, adjusted operating profit will be favorably influenced by the higher sales volume.
>>> In addition, we have higher expectations for productivity, but we also include provision for the potential negative net impact of tariffs for the remainder of the year, including the cost of tariffs themselves, offset by planned supply chain and commercial countermeasures.
     We are reducing our full year guidance for adjusted operating margin to 20.5% at the midpoint, approximately 50 basis points lower than prior guidance, of course, primarily driven by the estimated net impact of tariffs offset by favorable operating leverage on higher expected sales.
     This all translates into maintaining our adjusted diluted EPS at $3.55 at the midpoint, which is consistent with prior guidance and 25% higher than prior year despite the impact of tariffs.
     Once again, good growth for most years, but particularly impressive considering the uncertain and fluid environment.
     As Gio mentioned, there's still plenty of uncertainty and a ton of work to do, but we believe we are very well positioned to respond to the challenges, which is a good segue to the next slide, Slide 10, which due to the dynamic nature of the tariff environment, this slide depicts our adjusted operating profit under various scenarios.
     Of course, we anchor to our base guidance from the prior page, which is highlighted in blue here on Page 10, with the high end and low end of the adjusted operating profit guidance primarily driven by the upper and lower ends of the sales guidance on the previous slide.
     Once again, this guide assumes that the tariffs in place yesterday remain in effect for the remainder of the year.
     We also illustrate a few other scenarios to our base guidance, including an upside scenario of $2.015 billion at the top of the slide, and this is primarily driven by sales opportunities above the high end of our sales guidance, which is consistent with our continued favorable view of the market and growing orders pipeline.
-----
6. [Sentence #6813, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
     We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem necessary.
     Let's now move to the right side of the slide.
     The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.
     And this can create inefficiencies in the playbook and execution as we adjust to a changing landscape.
     This guidance is based on the tariffs in place on the 28 of July.
     We are vigorously executing tariff countermeasures.
>>> We believe tariffs will be materially offset exiting 2025.
     We are deliberately increasing spending in engineering and R&D, capacity and go-to-market to fuel growth.
     We are fine-tuning our supply chain as suppliers accelerate their localization efforts to address the tariff situation.
     Our supply chain resilience is helping us well.
     As growth accelerates, our capacity expansion strategy continues to be two-pronged: strategic manufacturing and service investment ahead of anticipated growth, capacity liberation through Vertiv operating system productivity improvement.
     Let's now go to Slide 5.
     Gray space and white space no longer are separate spaces.
     Gray space is the traditional critical infrastructure that powers and cools the data center.

7. [Sentence #6402, VRT_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     The agility and efficacy we have developed over the last couple of years is helping, but we're not standing still.
     We have a comprehensive set of actions underway.
     We are working towards the USMCA qualification for the remaining portion of our Mexico-based supply chain, we are actively rebalancing our global supply chain towards low or no tariff regions, and we are strategically relocating production while leveraging our U.S. manufacturing footprint.
     The commercial aspects of tariff mitigation are important.
     We have already taken some price actions in the market and will take more as necessary.
     Discussions with our customers about existing orders pricing actions where needed are also part of the mitigation strategy.
     We believe the impact of these mitigating actions will compound as the year progresses.
>>> Although the tariff environment remains fluid, our goal is to significantly mitigate the effect of tariffs as we enter 2026.
     But do not get me wrong.
     This is complicated, and there is a very large number of moving parts.
     We have established a detailed tariff playbook that allows us to monitor and respond to evolving trade dynamics.
     And with that, over to David.
     David Fallon

All right.
     Thanks, Gio.
     Turning to Slide 6.

8. [Sentence #6312, VRT_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     As we have said before, the digital revolution is happening, and it still has a long way to go.
     Data centers remain fundamental to all of it.
     AI adoption is spreading globally, data center demand remains robust and Vertiv is positioned extremely well to capitalize on these opportunities.
     Our portfolio, technology leadership and global scale are not easily replicated.
     Vertiv's management team has an intense focus on speed and strong execution, and that is amplifying our competitive advantages in this fast-growing market.
     Additionally, it's the only thing we do.
     So it gets a lot of attention.
>>> There's been a lot of turmoil lately about tariffs, which, of course, remains a fluid situation.
     The reality is, given our market position and operational flexibility we believe we're well positioned to handle the tariff situation.
     We have a sound playbook developed over several years to manage through this situation.
     We have manufacturing capabilities across multiple regions and our supply chain team has proven to navigate these challenges.
     I'm confident in our ability to handle what comes our way.
     All that being said, we do have to wait and see what actually transpires.
     We're still early in our Vertiv transformation.
     There's so much more value to unlock here and we've got the right team and strategy to do it.
-----
9. [Sentence #6811, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     As we have consistently said, orders in this industry can be lumpy, and this lumpiness can sometimes create unnecessary stock market reactions for Vertiv.
     Beginning on our Q4 and full year 2025 earnings call, we will provide projected full year orders rather than quarterly orders and backlog information.
     We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
     We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem necessary.
     Let's now move to the right side of the slide.
     The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.

     Or are there other kind of hiccups that you're having while you're adding capacity as far as getting components, getting tooling and stuff like that?
     I mean what -- just a little bit more granularity, I think, on where you're seeing those inefficiencies, I think, would be helpful.
     Giordano Albertazzi

Yes.
     I think it's a combination of things, Scott.
     And we have addressed that during the -- as we're going through the slides.
     But I really like to think about it in 3 ways.
     One is there is a tariff transition.
>>> I mean we talked about tariffs -- setting tariffs, et cetera, in a steady state.
     But when you transition from certain footprint of supply chain and manufacturing to another one that is more adjusted to the tariff, you have to involve new sources.
     Sometimes you have to have new certification.
     You have -- you move a backlog from one place to another.
     You have stops and goes.
     That, of course, inject inefficiency.
     And some of that, of course, you can fight, and you do, and we do.
     Some other is what you have to face.

11. [Sentence #6398, VRT_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     We have capacity in Mexico.
     Most of our Mexico capacity and production is already USMCA qualified, and we are driving towards 100% of qualification goal.
     Single digits portion of our demand is sourced from China, and we are deploying or have already deployed lower tariff or no tariff alternatives.
     A small portion of the U.S. demand comes from other regions, predominantly from EMEA and of course, that is being optimized.

     Of course, we'll stay agile and adapt as conditions evolve.
     We continue to focus on the Vertiv operating system.
     VOS is driving manufacturing productivity efficiency and is liberating capacity.
     We maintain a relentless focus on operational excellence across the organization.
     Let's move to Slide 5.
     Over the years, we have strengthened our pricing muscle and capabilities.
     And as I said, we are continuously optimizing our global supply.
>>> Let me take a moment to provide some clarity around our tariff mitigation strategy.
     Let's look at how we supply our American business.
     In the U.S., we have strong local capacity and we continue expanding it.
     We have capacity in Mexico.
     Most of our Mexico capacity and production is already USMCA qualified, and we are driving towards 100% of qualification goal.
     Single digits portion of our demand is sourced from China, and we are deploying or have already deployed lower tariff or no tariff alternatives.

     We also include 2 potential downside scenarios on this slide, one where we include provision for potential risk related to supply chain and commercial countermeasures and another below that where we estimate the potential negative impact of April 2 reciprocal tariff rates that were subject to a 90-day pause are indeed reinstated.
     Clearly, uncertainty remains, and there continues to be a lot of moving elements, but we believe these scenarios provide directional guardrails for possible outcomes.
     So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio.

     And conversations are ongoing in that respect.
     There is a very important element to the tariff mitigation aspect that has to do with the supply chain.
     And as soon as this was evident and we started to understand which direction tariffs were going, as I said, not always easy and certainly not always stable.
     But we pulled the rig configure as needed the supply chain level.
     And -- but of course, there is a lag between the very rigorous approach we have taken and we continue to take to shape our supply chain to match at best the tariff situation and the benefits that come from that.
     So clearly, this lag such that the impact will be greater as we progress through the year.
     So I don't know, David, if there's anything you want to add here or...

David Fallon

No.
>>> And just big picture, we do anticipate the dollar impact of tariffs to sequentially the net impact of tariffs to sequentially decline as we go through the year.
     And then the margin impact even more so as we'll gain the leverage on the higher sales in the back half of the year versus the first half.
     Scott Davis

If I could just -- yes, Gio, if I could just add, pursuing your comment in the transcript though, you're intent by year-end in terms of tariff neutrality?
     Giordano Albertazzi

Yes, confirmed.
     Absolutely.
     Operator

The next question go to Amit Daryanani of Evercore.
     Amit Daryanani

Congrats on a nice print.
     I guess my question is really around, you folks have had really impressive performance on orders, both sequentially and year-over-year basis, given some very difficult compares you had.
-----
16. [Sentence #5917, VRT_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     We go to the right side of Slide four.
     Supply chain resilience continues to strengthen.
     We have matured as an organization in this area.
     We have been successfully working to drive geographic balance and we continue doing so.
     We have multiple sources of supply to deal with geographical uncertainty.
     We believe price cost will be positive for 2025.
     While questions remain relative to potential tariff impacts, we have been adding regional sourcing and manufacturing options to complement our existing global supply chain.
>>> The situation with tariffs remains very fluid, so it would be premature to discuss it in detail.
     At the same time, it is worth mentioning we have of course built scenarios and playbooks aimed at strategically mitigating some of the tariff impacts.
     To be clear, although there is much uncertainty regarding the scope and breadth of tariffs, we believe we are well prepared to take strategic actions to help mitigate risks.
     For example, in 2024, we expanded and strengthened our supply base and manufacturing footprint in the United States as part of our overall capacity strategy to grow with the customer demand we see in the U.S. Vertiv operating system is truly becoming part of the culture that is translating into tangible productivity gains.
     It is also liberating capacity needed to support the strong demand trajectory in combination with our ongoing footprint expansion.
     Let's now move to Slide five.
     I want to highlight the importance and the strength of our power portfolio.
     Much of the recent focus has been on thermal technology, which of course we love.
-----
17. [Sentence #6624, VRT_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     There is colo for hyperscalers, but increasingly not only.
     Let's not forget that all the new cloud, let's say, space that is promising.
     Sovereign, as in our [indiscernible] example is started to happen and enterprise, it doesn't show interest in AI and infrastructure in general.
     So it's pretty normal that sometimes someone rephases something, pretty much have demand to cover any gaps.
     But again, I'm not talking specifically for one customer.
     And then in general, we should go on a product line by product line basis to see exactly how that answer questions should be answered, but much details at that stage to disclose.
     Operator

The next question goes to Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.
>>> Nicole DeBlase

Can we just talk a little bit about the ability to go back and reprice the backlog what's baked in from a contractual perspective with respect to tariffs.
     If you started to have those conversations have customers been somewhat understanding of what's happening?
     And I guess, how much of a risk that part of the equation is since the backlog is pretty robust?
     Giordano Albertazzi

Yes.
     The conversations are ongoing.
     Some of the conversations are ongoing, where that need exists.
     Clearly, contracts are supporting, sometimes more, sometimes less.
     Every single contract is a different situation.

18. [Sentence #6889, VRT_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     Implied is a 150 basis point sequential improvement from the second quarter primarily driven by progress in resolving some of the operational inefficiencies and execution challenges.
     Moving to Slide 9, let me walk you through our full year financial guidance.
     We are raising projected adjusted EPS to $3.80, 33% higher than last year, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower net interest.
     We are raising our full year top line guide by $150 million to $10 billion, with $110 million of this increase from favorable foreign exchange.
     The resulting underlying organic growth of 24% is driven by expected continued growth in the Americas and APAC, while we expect EMEA to be relatively flat.
     For adjusted operating profit, we are raising our full year guidance to just under $2 billion, up 28% from last year.
     And as Gio mentioned, this guidance assumes tariffs active on July 28.
>>> We expect, all other things being equal, a possible downside scenario from potential August 1 tariffs as currently understood, and things are changing rapidly and somewhat challenging to quantify.
     But we believe that would still place our full year adjusted operating profit within our guidance range for adjusted operating profit.
     Full year adjusted operating margin is projected to be approximately 20% at the midpoint, 60 basis points higher than last year despite tariff headwinds, and 50 basis points lower than prior guidance.
     We continue to drive margin improvement, including positive price/ cost and productivity.
     And implied in our guidance is fourth quarter adjusted operating margin in excess of 23%, once again, keeping us on track to attain our long-term target by 2029.
     And finally on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $1.4 billion, up $100 million from prior guidance, driving full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to 95% as we continue to drive initiatives to optimize trade working capital.
     And when you piece it all together, the growth trajectory, the margin progression and the free cash flow performance, these numbers certainly demonstrate the continued strength of our execution and our ability to drive significant growth while expanding margins.
     We tucked the fourth quarter guidance slide in the appendix, and if you look at the exit rates across all financial metrics, we believe we should be very well positioned for a strong start to 2026.
-----
19. [Sentence #5069, VRT_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We are very proud about what we printed in second quarter and let's make sure that we keep an eye on the trajectory on the long-term trajectory and the long-term trajectory is very strong.
     Operator

Thank you.
     We now have Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs on the line.
     Mark Delaney

Yes.
     Thank you so much for taking my question which is on pricing.
     Vertiv have been expecting a bit more than $60 million of net price cost positivity for this year.
     Can you speak just qualitatively on how the pricing environment has evolved?
>>> And are you seeing that pricing become any more competitive in new programs that come up for bid, given increased competition in certain parts of the industry?
     And if so, is that potentially limiting the degree of price cost positivity over the longer term?
     Thank you.
     Gio Albertazzi

Absolutely.
     We continue to operate in a market that is favorable from a demand and supply balance standpoint.
     We have very strong competitive advantages in the market, so we feel good about what we're doing.
     We feel very good about the pricing muscles and muscle and pricing strength that we have built over the last 2, 3 years.
     So things continue to be encouraging in that respect.

     ODMs in a play that for liquid cooling sometimes is a white space play.
     They have a role with their servers, with their racks, with their integration.
     So it’s natural that they integrate liquid cooling technology in what they do.
     Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.
     And when they do, they can do that with private labeled products or they can do with products that are the original vendors labeled.
     When we think about those ODMs, we think of them as a go-to-market for us.
     And those ODMs very often also rely on our ability not only to deliver and provide technology, but also to provide the service and the liquid cooling know-how at rack, row and system level that they might need kind of being complemented with.
>>> So we do not look at that part of the market as competition.
     We look at a part of the market that we have opportunity to synergize with.

     The regulatory environment is becoming more conducive to AI infrastructure investment, reflected in our customer discussions and pipelines.
     While we are on the topic of orders, let me briefly explain a change in how we'll communicate orders.
     As we have consistently said, orders in this industry can be lumpy, and this lumpiness can sometimes create unnecessary stock market reactions for Vertiv.
     Beginning on our Q4 and full year 2025 earnings call, we will provide projected full year orders rather than quarterly orders and backlog information.
     We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
     We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem necessary.
     Let's now move to the right side of the slide.
>>> The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.
     And this can create inefficiencies in the playbook and execution as we adjust to a changing landscape.
     This guidance is based on the tariffs in place on the 28 of July.
     We are vigorously executing tariff countermeasures.
     We believe tariffs will be materially offset exiting 2025.
     We are deliberately increasing spending in engineering and R&D, capacity and go-to-market to fuel growth.
     We are fine-tuning our supply chain as suppliers accelerate their localization efforts to address the tariff situation.
     Our supply chain resilience is helping us well.

     We have matured as an organization in this area.
     We have been successfully working to drive geographic balance and we continue doing so.
     We have multiple sources of supply to deal with geographical uncertainty.
     We believe price cost will be positive for 2025.
     While questions remain relative to potential tariff impacts, we have been adding regional sourcing and manufacturing options to complement our existing global supply chain.
     The situation with tariffs remains very fluid, so it would be premature to discuss it in detail.
     At the same time, it is worth mentioning we have of course built scenarios and playbooks aimed at strategically mitigating some of the tariff impacts.
>>> To be clear, although there is much uncertainty regarding the scope and breadth of tariffs, we believe we are well prepared to take strategic actions to help mitigate risks.
     For example, in 2024, we expanded and strengthened our supply base and manufacturing footprint in the United States as part of our overall capacity strategy to grow with the customer demand we see in the U.S. Vertiv operating system is truly becoming part of the culture that is translating into tangible productivity gains.
     It is also liberating capacity needed to support the strong demand trajectory in combination with our ongoing footprint expansion.
     Let's now move to Slide five.
     I want to highlight the importance and the strength of our power portfolio.
     Much of the recent focus has been on thermal technology, which of course we love.
     There is an equally exciting story around power for Vertiv.
     Complex technology changes are happening in the data center at a speed the industry has not seen before.

     We expect adjusted operating margin of 20%, relatively consistent with 2024, despite tariff headwinds, as we continue to leverage higher sales and drive positive price/cost.
     Implied is a 150 basis point sequential improvement from the second quarter primarily driven by progress in resolving some of the operational inefficiencies and execution challenges.
     Moving to Slide 9, let me walk you through our full year financial guidance.
     We are raising projected adjusted EPS to $3.80, 33% higher than last year, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower net interest.
     We are raising our full year top line guide by $150 million to $10 billion, with $110 million of this increase from favorable foreign exchange.
     The resulting underlying organic growth of 24% is driven by expected continued growth in the Americas and APAC, while we expect EMEA to be relatively flat.
     For adjusted operating profit, we are raising our full year guidance to just under $2 billion, up 28% from last year.
>>> And as Gio mentioned, this guidance assumes tariffs active on July 28.
     We expect, all other things being equal, a possible downside scenario from potential August 1 tariffs as currently understood, and things are changing rapidly and somewhat challenging to quantify.
     But we believe that would still place our full year adjusted operating profit within our guidance range for adjusted operating profit.
     Full year adjusted operating margin is projected to be approximately 20% at the midpoint, 60 basis points higher than last year despite tariff headwinds, and 50 basis points lower than prior guidance.
     We continue to drive margin improvement, including positive price/ cost and productivity.
     And implied in our guidance is fourth quarter adjusted operating margin in excess of 23%, once again, keeping us on track to attain our long-term target by 2029.
     And finally on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $1.4 billion, up $100 million from prior guidance, driving full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to 95% as we continue to drive initiatives to optimize trade working capital.
     And when you piece it all together, the growth trajectory, the margin progression and the free cash flow performance, these numbers certainly demonstrate the continued strength of our execution and our ability to drive significant growth while expanding margins.

     Moving to Page 8.
     This slide summarizes our second quarter guidance.
     We expect continued top line momentum, including 15% sequential quarterly growth and 21% growth from last year's second quarter, with both the Americas and APAC, once against growing once again growing more than 20% year-over-year, and we continue to be prudent with growth expectations in EMEA.
     Tariff costs will certainly accelerate in the second quarter from the first quarter.
     And with limited time to mitigate with either supply chain or commercial countermeasures, our adjusted operating margin will be negatively influenced.
     If tariff rates in effect today remain in effect for the entire second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margin to be 18.5%, about 110 basis points lower than last year's second quarter.
     However, excluding the estimated net tariff impact, adjusted operating margin would show good expansion, which implies that tariffs more than explain the year-over-year reduction and underlying margin expansion drivers, including operational leverage, productivity and commercial execution remains strong, and we believe we continue to be on track for our long-term margin targets.
>>> And finally, despite the negative impact from tariffs, our second quarter adjusted operating profit is still growing 14% and our adjusted diluted EPS is still growing an impressive 21% from last year, strong growth even in a world without tariffs.
     Next, moving to Page 9.
     This slide updates our full year 2025 financial guidance.
     In summary, compared to prior guidance, we are increasing top line projections and including estimated net tariff costs.
     First, we are increasing full year sales guidance by $250 million, including approximately $150 million organically and approximately $100 million from favorable foreign exchange.
     The $150 million increase in organic sales is driven by both the first quarter and higher expectations in the second quarter versus what was implied in our prior guidance.
     Regionally, we are increasing full year expectations for both the Americas and APAC, while lowering projections for EMEA.
     Full year organic sales growth is now expected to be 18% at the midpoint, 2 percentage points higher than our prior guidance.
