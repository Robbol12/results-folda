We now have a question from Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley.
    Christopher M. Snyder

I wanted to ask on gross margin.
    We have obviously come under some pressure here in the first half, after a period of very healthy expansion.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this only a function of tariffs and some of the inefficiencies discussed earlier?</span>
    Or are there also headwinds from whether it be mix or new technologies ramping, i.e.
    liquid cooling?
    When you guys look at the backlog, is the expectation that gross margin return to expansion in Q4 and that kind of 
helps provide that operating lift?
    Or is that still a little bit further out?
    Giordano Albertazzi

A couple of things I&#x27;d be pleased to add.
    We are happy about the new technologies, and I think the new technologies corroborate our value story and certainly 
our margin story.
    As we explained, there is -- there are tariff elements and, certainly, growth, inefficiency in the operational 
aspects that we, I think, have discussed.

    There was an aspect about diversity.
    I&#x27;d say that clearly, if we think about the part of the market that grows the fastest, we&#x27;re certainly thinking what

    Just given this kind of remarkable demand pulse you&#x27;re seeing, do you have kind of the commercial leverage to fully

    We&#x27;re just talking about some kind of delay in terms of moving through the order backlog and converting to sales.

Well, I really have a hard time, Jeff, reconciling these <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> questions into one.
    So let me start from the AWS one.
    So in general, think in terms of hyperscalers having certainly a very strong opinion on how they want their 
infrastructure to be.

    Q2 orders were up approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% from Q2 <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;24, and certainly not an easy comp, and up 11% sequentially from 1Q </span>

    Our trailing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>-month organic orders growth was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">11</span>%.
    Our Q2 book-to-bill ratio of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.</span>2x is particularly encouraging.
    We continue to build backlog at very high levels.
    Momentum in our business is accelerating.
    Our Q2 adjusted operating profit was $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">489</span> million, up <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span>% year-on-year, driven by higher sales.
    Our adjusted operating margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%, in line with guidance, is approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">110</span> basis points lower than prior 
year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This was primarily driven by the net impact of tariffs.</span>
    Our updated guidance takes into consideration tariffs active on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span> of July, reflecting a moderate improvement in
the tariff situation compared to our Q1 guidance.
    The temporary costs of the supply chain and manufacturing transition to tariff-optimized footprint are higher than 
we initially estimated.
    We&#x27;re also experiencing some temporary costs to deliver a steeper growth than expected and some executional 
challenges in EMEA.
    We expect all these factors will significantly moderate during the year, and we believe they will be materially 
resolved by year-end.
    For Q3 and for the full year, we are raising our investment in ER&amp;D and in growth compared to prior guidance.
    Our second quarter free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">277</span> million, though lower on a year-on-year basis, corroborates a strong cash 
generation trend, with adjusted free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">542</span> million in the first half, a robust growth of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span>% year-on-year.
    This performance was driven by our improved operational execution, resulting in higher adjusting operating profit.

    So in general, think in terms of hyperscalers having certainly a very strong opinion on how they want their

    Now no <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> hyperscalers have the same behaviors.

    First, we are increasing full year sales guidance by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">250</span> million, including approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million organically 
and approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million from favorable foreign exchange.
    The $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million increase in organic sales is driven by both the first quarter and higher expectations in the second
quarter versus what was implied in our prior guidance.
    Regionally, we are increasing full year expectations for both the Americas and APAC, while lowering projections for 
EMEA.
    Full year organic sales growth is now expected to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span>% at the midpoint, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> percentage points higher than our prior 
guidance.
    We are maintaining our full year guidance for adjusted operating profit at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.935</span> billion at the midpoint.
    This guidance assumes that tariff rates in effect yesterday remain in effect for the remainder of the year.
    Of course, adjusted operating profit will be favorably influenced by the higher sales volume.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition, we have higher expectations for productivity, but we also include provision for the potential negative </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">net impact of tariffs for the remainder of the year, including the cost of tariffs themselves, offset by planned supply </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">chain and commercial countermeasures.</span>
    We are reducing our full year guidance for adjusted operating margin to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20.5</span>% at the midpoint, approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> 
basis points lower than prior guidance, of course, primarily driven by the estimated net impact of tariffs offset by 
favorable operating leverage on higher expected sales.
    This all translates into maintaining our adjusted diluted EPS at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.55</span> at the midpoint, which is consistent with 
prior guidance and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% higher than prior year despite the impact of tariffs.
    Once again, good growth for most years, but particularly impressive considering the uncertain and fluid environment.
    As Gio mentioned, there&#x27;s still plenty of uncertainty and a ton of work to do, but we believe we are very well 
positioned to respond to the challenges, which is a good segue to the next slide, Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>, which due to the dynamic 
nature of the tariff environment, this slide depicts our adjusted operating profit under various scenarios.
    Of course, we anchor to our base guidance from the prior page, which is highlighted in blue here on Page <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>, with 
the high end and low end of the adjusted operating profit guidance primarily driven by the upper and lower ends of the 
sales guidance on the previous slide.
    Once again, this guide assumes that the tariffs in place yesterday remain in effect for the remainder of the year.
    We also illustrate a few other scenarios to our base guidance, including an upside scenario of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.015</span> billion at the
top of the slide, and this is primarily driven by sales opportunities above the high end of our sales guidance, which is
consistent with our continued favorable view of the market and growing orders pipeline.

    We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
    We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem 
necessary.
    Let&#x27;s now move to the right side of the slide.
    The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.
    And this can create inefficiencies in the playbook and execution as we adjust to a changing landscape.
    This guidance is based on the tariffs in place on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span> of July.
    We are vigorously executing tariff countermeasures.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We believe tariffs will be materially offset exiting </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">.</span>
    We are deliberately increasing spending in engineering and R&amp;D, capacity and go-to-market to fuel growth.
    We are fine-tuning our supply chain as suppliers accelerate their localization efforts to address the tariff 
situation.
    Our supply chain resilience is helping us well.
    As growth accelerates, our capacity expansion strategy continues to be two-pronged: strategic manufacturing and 
service investment ahead of anticipated growth, capacity liberation through Vertiv operating system productivity 
improvement.

    The agility and efficacy we have developed over the last couple of years is helping, but we&#x27;re not standing still.
    We have a comprehensive set of actions underway.
    We are working towards the USMCA qualification for the remaining portion of our Mexico-based supply chain, we are 
actively rebalancing our global supply chain towards low or no tariff regions, and we are strategically relocating 
production while leveraging our U.S. manufacturing footprint.
    The commercial aspects of tariff mitigation are important.
    We have already taken some price actions in the market and will take more as necessary.
    Discussions with our customers about existing orders pricing actions where needed are also part of the mitigation 
strategy.
    We believe the impact of these mitigating actions will compound as the year progresses.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the tariff environment remains fluid, our goal is to significantly mitigate the effect of tariffs as we </span>

    But do not get me wrong.
    This is complicated, and there is a very large number of moving parts.
    We have established a detailed tariff playbook that allows us to monitor and respond to evolving trade dynamics.
    And with that, over to David.

    As we have said before, the digital revolution is happening, and it still has a long way to go.
    Data centers remain fundamental to all of it.
    AI adoption is spreading globally, data center demand remains robust and Vertiv is positioned extremely well to 
capitalize on these opportunities.
    Our portfolio, technology leadership and global scale are not easily replicated.
    Vertiv&#x27;s management team has an intense focus on speed and strong execution, and that is amplifying our competitive 
advantages in this fast-growing market.
    Additionally, it&#x27;s the only thing we do.
    So it gets a lot of attention.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s been a lot of turmoil lately about tariffs, which, of course, remains a fluid situation.</span>
    The reality is, given our market position and operational flexibility we believe we&#x27;re well positioned to handle the
tariff situation.
    We have a sound playbook developed over several years to manage through this situation.
    We have manufacturing capabilities across multiple regions and our supply chain team has proven to navigate these 
challenges.
    I&#x27;m confident in our ability to handle what comes our way.
    All that being said, we do have to wait and see what actually transpires.
    We&#x27;re still early in our Vertiv transformation.
    There&#x27;s so much more value to unlock here and we&#x27;ve got the right team and strategy to do it.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    As we have consistently said, orders in this industry can be lumpy, and this lumpiness can sometimes create 
unnecessary stock market reactions for Vertiv.
    Beginning on our Q4 and full year <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> earnings call, we will provide projected full year orders rather than 
quarterly orders and backlog information.
    We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
    We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem 
necessary.
    Let&#x27;s now move to the right side of the slide.
    The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.
    And this can create inefficiencies in the playbook and execution as we adjust to a changing landscape.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This guidance is based on the tariffs in place on the </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">28</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> of July.</span>
    We are vigorously executing tariff countermeasures.
    We believe tariffs will be materially offset exiting <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are deliberately increasing spending in engineering and R&amp;D, capacity and go-to-market to fuel growth.
    We are fine-tuning our supply chain as suppliers accelerate their localization efforts to address the tariff 
situation.
    Our supply chain resilience is helping us well.
    As growth accelerates, our capacity expansion strategy continues to be two-pronged: strategic manufacturing and 
service investment ahead of anticipated growth, capacity liberation through Vertiv operating system productivity 
improvement.
    Let&#x27;s now go to Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>.

    Or are there other kind of hiccups that you&#x27;re having while you&#x27;re adding capacity as far as getting components, 
getting tooling and stuff like that?
    I mean what -- just a little bit more granularity, I think, on where you&#x27;re seeing those inefficiencies, I think, 
would be helpful.
    Giordano Albertazzi

Yes.
    I think it&#x27;s a combination of things, Scott.
    And we have addressed that during the -- as we&#x27;re going through the slides.
    But I really like to think about it in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ways.
    One is there is a tariff transition.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean we talked about tariffs -- setting tariffs, et cetera, in a steady state.</span>
    But when you transition from certain footprint of supply chain and manufacturing to another one that is more 
adjusted to the tariff, you have to involve new sources.
    Sometimes you have to have new certification.
    You have -- you move a backlog from one place to another.
    You have stops and goes.
    That, of course, inject inefficiency.
    And some of that, of course, you can fight, and you do, and we do.
    Some other is what you have to face.

    We have capacity in Mexico.
    Most of our Mexico capacity and production is already USMCA qualified, and we are driving towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% of 
qualification goal.
    Single digits portion of our demand is sourced from China, and we are deploying or have already deployed lower 
tariff or no tariff alternatives.
    A small portion of the U.S. demand comes from other regions, predominantly from EMEA and of course, that is being 
optimized.
    The agility and efficacy we have developed over the last couple of years is helping, but we&#x27;re not standing still.
    We have a comprehensive set of actions underway.
    We are working towards the USMCA qualification for the remaining portion of our Mexico-based supply chain, we are 
actively rebalancing our global supply chain towards low or no tariff regions, and we are strategically relocating 
production while leveraging our U.S. manufacturing footprint.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The commercial aspects of tariff mitigation are important.</span>
    We have already taken some price actions in the market and will take more as necessary.
    Discussions with our customers about existing orders pricing actions where needed are also part of the mitigation 
strategy.
    We believe the impact of these mitigating actions will compound as the year progresses.
    Although the tariff environment remains fluid, our goal is to significantly mitigate the effect of tariffs as we 
enter <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    But do not get me wrong.
    This is complicated, and there is a very large number of moving parts.
    We have established a detailed tariff playbook that allows us to monitor and respond to evolving trade dynamics.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Of course, we&#x27;ll stay agile and adapt as conditions evolve.
    We continue to focus on the Vertiv operating system.
    VOS is driving manufacturing productivity efficiency and is liberating capacity.
    We maintain a relentless focus on operational excellence across the organization.
    Let&#x27;s move to Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>.
    Over the years, we have strengthened our pricing muscle and capabilities.
    And as I said, we are continuously optimizing our global supply.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me take a moment to provide some clarity around our tariff mitigation strategy.</span>
    Let&#x27;s look at how we supply our American business.
    In the U.S., we have strong local capacity and we continue expanding it.
    We have capacity in Mexico.
    Most of our Mexico capacity and production is already USMCA qualified, and we are driving towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% of

    Of course, adjusted operating profit will be favorably influenced by the higher sales volume.
    In addition, we have higher expectations for productivity, but we also include provision for the potential negative 
net impact of tariffs for the remainder of the year, including the cost of tariffs themselves, offset by planned supply 
chain and commercial countermeasures.
    We are reducing our full year guidance for adjusted operating margin to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20.5</span>% at the midpoint, approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> 
basis points lower than prior guidance, of course, primarily driven by the estimated net impact of tariffs offset by 
favorable operating leverage on higher expected sales.
    This all translates into maintaining our adjusted diluted EPS at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.55</span> at the midpoint, which is consistent with 
prior guidance and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% higher than prior year despite the impact of tariffs.
    Once again, good growth for most years, but particularly impressive considering the uncertain and fluid environment.
    As Gio mentioned, there&#x27;s still plenty of uncertainty and a ton of work to do, but we believe we are very well 
positioned to respond to the challenges, which is a good segue to the next slide, Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>, which due to the dynamic 
nature of the tariff environment, this slide depicts our adjusted operating profit under various scenarios.
    Of course, we anchor to our base guidance from the prior page, which is highlighted in blue here on Page <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>, with 
the high end and low end of the adjusted operating profit guidance primarily driven by the upper and lower ends of the 
sales guidance on the previous slide.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Once again, this guide assumes that the tariffs in place yesterday remain in effect for the remainder of the year.</span>
    We also illustrate a few other scenarios to our base guidance, including an upside scenario of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.015</span> billion at the
top of the slide, and this is primarily driven by sales opportunities above the high end of our sales guidance, which is
consistent with our continued favorable view of the market and growing orders pipeline.
    We also include <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> potential downside scenarios on this slide, one where we include provision for potential risk 
related to supply chain and commercial countermeasures and another below that where we estimate the potential negative 
impact of April <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> reciprocal tariff rates that were subject to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>-day pause are indeed reinstated.
    Clearly, uncertainty remains, and there continues to be a lot of moving elements, but we believe these scenarios 
provide directional guardrails for possible outcomes.
    So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio.

    And conversations are ongoing in that respect.
    There is a very important element to the tariff mitigation aspect that has to do with the supply chain.
    And as soon as this was evident and we started to understand which direction tariffs were going, as I said, not 
always easy and certainly not always stable.
    But we pulled the rig configure as needed the supply chain level.
    And -- but of course, there is a lag between the very rigorous approach we have taken and we continue to take to 
shape our supply chain to match at best the tariff situation and the benefits that come from that.
    So clearly, this lag such that the impact will be greater as we progress through the year.
    So I don&#x27;t know, David, if there&#x27;s anything you want to add here or<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

David Fallon

No.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And just big picture, we do anticipate the dollar impact of tariffs to sequentially the net impact of tariffs to </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">sequentially decline as we go through the year.</span>
    And then the margin impact even more so as we&#x27;ll gain the leverage on the higher sales in the back half of the year 
versus the first half.
    Scott Davis

If I could just -- yes, Gio, if I could just add, pursuing your comment in the transcript though, you&#x27;re intent by 
year-end in terms of tariff neutrality?

    We go to the right side of Slide four.
    Supply chain resilience continues to strengthen.
    We have matured as an organization in this area.
    We have been successfully working to drive geographic balance and we continue doing so.
    We have multiple sources of supply to deal with geographical uncertainty.
    We believe price cost will be positive for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    While questions remain relative to potential tariff impacts, we have been adding regional sourcing and manufacturing
options to complement our existing global supply chain.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The situation with tariffs remains very fluid, so it would be premature to discuss it in detail.</span>
    At the same time, it is worth mentioning we have of course built scenarios and playbooks aimed at strategically 
mitigating some of the tariff impacts.
    To be clear, although there is much uncertainty regarding the scope and breadth of tariffs, we believe we are well 
prepared to take strategic actions to help mitigate risks.
    For example, in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, we expanded and strengthened our supply base and manufacturing footprint in the United States 
as part of our overall capacity strategy to grow with the customer demand we see in the U.S. Vertiv operating system is 
truly becoming part of the culture that is translating into tangible productivity gains.
    It is also liberating capacity needed to support the strong demand trajectory in combination with our ongoing 
footprint expansion.
    Let&#x27;s now move to Slide five.

    There is colo for hyperscalers, but increasingly not only.
    Let&#x27;s not forget that all the new cloud, let&#x27;s say, space that is promising.
    Sovereign, as in our  example is started to happen and enterprise, it doesn&#x27;t show interest in AI and infrastructure
in general.
    So it&#x27;s pretty normal that sometimes someone rephases something, pretty much have demand to cover any gaps.
    But again, I&#x27;m not talking specifically for one customer.
    And then in general, we should go on a product line by product line basis to see exactly how that answer questions 
should be answered, but much details at that stage to disclose.

    If you started to have those conversations have customers been somewhat understanding of what&#x27;s happening?
    And I guess, how much of a risk that part of the equation is since the backlog is pretty robust?
    Giordano Albertazzi

Yes.
    The conversations are ongoing.
    Some of the conversations are ongoing, where that need exists.

resolving some of the operational inefficiencies and execution challenges.
    Moving to Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>, let me walk you through our full year financial guidance.
    We are raising projected adjusted EPS to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.80</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">33</span>% higher than last year, primarily driven by higher adjusted 
operating profit and lower net interest.
    We are raising our full year top line guide by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> billion, with $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">110</span> million of this increase from 
favorable foreign exchange.
    The resulting underlying organic growth of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span>% is driven by expected continued growth in the Americas and APAC, 
while we expect EMEA to be relatively flat.
    For adjusted operating profit, we are raising our full year guidance to just under $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion, up <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span>% from last 
year.
    And as Gio mentioned, this guidance assumes tariffs active on July <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span>.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect, all other things being equal, a possible downside scenario from potential August </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> tariffs as currently </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">understood, and things are changing rapidly and somewhat challenging to quantify.</span>
    But we believe that would still place our full year adjusted operating profit within our guidance range for adjusted
operating profit.
    Full year adjusted operating margin is projected to be approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% at the midpoint, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> basis points higher 
than last year despite tariff headwinds, and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> basis points lower than prior guidance.
    We continue to drive margin improvement, including positive price/ cost and productivity.
    And implied in our guidance is fourth quarter adjusted operating margin in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">23</span>%, once again, keeping us on 
track to attain our long-term target by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2029</span>.
    And finally on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.4</span> billion, up $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> 
million from prior guidance, driving full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">95</span>% as we continue to drive 
initiatives to optimize trade working capital.
    And when you piece it all together, the growth trajectory, the margin progression and the free cash flow 
performance, these numbers certainly demonstrate the continued strength of our execution and our ability to drive 
significant growth while expanding margins.
    We tucked the fourth quarter guidance slide in the appendix, and if you look at the exit rates across all financial 
metrics, we believe we should be very well positioned for a strong start to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.

Thank you.
    We now have Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs on the line.
    Mark Delaney

Yes.
    Thank you so much for taking my question which is on pricing.
    Vertiv have been expecting a bit more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> million of net price cost positivity for this year.
    Can you speak just qualitatively on how the pricing environment has evolved?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And are you seeing that pricing become any more competitive in new programs that come up for bid, given increased </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">competition in certain parts of the industry?</span>
    And if so, is that potentially limiting the degree of price cost positivity over the longer term?
    Thank you.
    Gio Albertazzi

Absolutely.
    We continue to operate in a market that is favorable from a demand and supply balance standpoint.
    We have very strong competitive advantages in the market, so we feel good about what we&#x27;re doing.
    We feel very good about the pricing muscles and muscle and pricing strength that we have built over the last <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>

    ODMs in a play that for liquid cooling sometimes is a white space play.
    They have a role with their servers, with their racks, with their integration.
    So it’s natural that they integrate liquid cooling technology in what they do.
    Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.
    And when they do, they can do that with private labeled products or they can do with products that are the original 
vendors labeled.
    When we think about those ODMs, we think of them as a go-to-market for us.
    And those ODMs very often also rely on our ability not only to deliver and provide technology, but also to provide 
the service and the liquid cooling know-how at rack, row and system level that they might need kind of being 
complemented with.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we do not look at that part of the market as competition.</span>
    We look at a part of the market that we have opportunity to synergize with.

    The regulatory environment is becoming more conducive to AI infrastructure investment, reflected in our customer 
discussions and pipelines.
    While we are on the topic of orders, let me briefly explain a change in how we&#x27;ll communicate orders.
    As we have consistently said, orders in this industry can be lumpy, and this lumpiness can sometimes create 
unnecessary stock market reactions for Vertiv.
    Beginning on our Q4 and full year <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> earnings call, we will provide projected full year orders rather than 
quarterly orders and backlog information.
    We believe this better aligns with how we run our business.
    We will provide updates on the full year projections quarterly as we progress through the year and as we deem 
necessary.
    Let&#x27;s now move to the right side of the slide.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The tariff situation remains quite dynamic and fluid, with the tariff perimeter changing frequently.</span>
    And this can create inefficiencies in the playbook and execution as we adjust to a changing landscape.
    This guidance is based on the tariffs in place on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">28</span> of July.
    We are vigorously executing tariff countermeasures.
    We believe tariffs will be materially offset exiting <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    We are deliberately increasing spending in engineering and R&amp;D, capacity and go-to-market to fuel growth.
    We are fine-tuning our supply chain as suppliers accelerate their localization efforts to address the tariff 
situation.
    Our supply chain resilience is helping us well.

    We have matured as an organization in this area.
    We have been successfully working to drive geographic balance and we continue doing so.
    We have multiple sources of supply to deal with geographical uncertainty.
    We believe price cost will be positive for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    While questions remain relative to potential tariff impacts, we have been adding regional sourcing and manufacturing
options to complement our existing global supply chain.
    The situation with tariffs remains very fluid, so it would be premature to discuss it in detail.
    At the same time, it is worth mentioning we have of course built scenarios and playbooks aimed at strategically 
mitigating some of the tariff impacts.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; To be clear, although there is much uncertainty regarding the scope and breadth of tariffs, we believe we are well </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">prepared to take strategic actions to help mitigate risks.</span>
    For example, in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, we expanded and strengthened our supply base and manufacturing footprint in the United States 
as part of our overall capacity strategy to grow with the customer demand we see in the U.S. Vertiv operating system is 
truly becoming part of the culture that is translating into tangible productivity gains.
    It is also liberating capacity needed to support the strong demand trajectory in combination with our ongoing 
footprint expansion.
    Let&#x27;s now move to Slide five.
    I want to highlight the importance and the strength of our power portfolio.
    Much of the recent focus has been on thermal technology, which of course we love.
    There is an equally exciting story around power for Vertiv.

    Moving to Page <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>.
    This slide summarizes our second quarter guidance.
    We expect continued top line momentum, including <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% sequential quarterly growth and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>% growth from last year&#x27;s 
second quarter, with both the Americas and APAC, once against growing once again growing more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% year-over-year, 
and we continue to be prudent with growth expectations in EMEA.
    Tariff costs will certainly accelerate in the second quarter from the first quarter.
    And with limited time to mitigate with either supply chain or commercial countermeasures, our adjusted operating 
margin will be negatively influenced.
    If tariff rates in effect today remain in effect for the entire second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margin 
to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%, about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">110</span> basis points lower than last year&#x27;s second quarter.
    However, excluding the estimated net tariff impact, adjusted operating margin would show good expansion, which 
implies that tariffs more than explain the year-over-year reduction and underlying margin expansion drivers, including 
operational leverage, productivity and commercial execution remains strong, and we believe we continue to be on track 
for our long-term margin targets.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And finally, despite the negative impact from tariffs, our second quarter adjusted operating profit is still growing</span>

    Next, moving to Page <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>.
    This slide updates our full year <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> financial guidance.
    In summary, compared to prior guidance, we are increasing top line projections and including estimated net tariff 
costs.
    First, we are increasing full year sales guidance by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">250</span> million, including approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million organically 
and approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million from favorable foreign exchange.
    The $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> million increase in organic sales is driven by both the first quarter and higher expectations in the second
quarter versus what was implied in our prior guidance.
    Regionally, we are increasing full year expectations for both the Americas and APAC, while lowering projections for 
EMEA.
    Full year organic sales growth is now expected to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span>% at the midpoint, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> percentage points higher than our prior 
guidance.
