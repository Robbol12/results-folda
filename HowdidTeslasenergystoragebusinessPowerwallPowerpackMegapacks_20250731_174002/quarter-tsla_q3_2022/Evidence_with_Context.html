    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the <span class="r3">1</span>% point come in.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to 
actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
    So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
    But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- 
people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
    And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to 
buffer the power.
    So, you have <span class="r3">24</span>/<span class="r3">7</span> power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like </span><span class="r5">150</span><span class="r5">% to </span><span class="r5">200</span><span class="r5">% a </span>
<span class="r5">year, faster than cars by a lot.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.
    Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where 
our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our 
capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
    So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
    And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has 
mentioned.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we try to model out like, let’s say, <span class="r3">2023</span> is a brutal recession year.
    Even then, we generate meaningful cash.

    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span class="r3">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span class="r3">27.9</span>%.
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span class="r3">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record </span>
<span class="r5">volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.</span>
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
    Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound 
logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
    Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the 
final two weeks.
    As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound 
logistics.
    We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.

Right.
    Basically, production of <span class="r3">4680</span> ramp is growing exponentially.
    And yes, it’s going well.
    We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

<span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span>

Elon Musk

Yes.
    And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in 
United States alone by Tesla, not including , will be on top of that.
    Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get <span class="r3">300</span> to <span class="r3">400</span> terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is </span><span class="r5">300</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span>
<span class="r5">to </span><span class="r5">400</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours or </span><span class="r5">300</span><span class="r5"> to </span><span class="r5">400</span><span class="r5"> terawatt hours.</span>
    Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high 
tonnage and then some nickel.
    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
    And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
    But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
    Yes.
    At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
    So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the 
cars.

<span class="r5">Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.</span>
    I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
    And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
    There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.
    Just try one.
    Epic.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r3">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r5">a </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r3">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?

    I’ll be there in person.
    And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
    That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, </span><span class="r5">500</span><span class="r5">-mile range.</span>
    Just to be clear, <span class="r3">500</span> miles with the cargo.
    Yes, <span class="r3">500</span> miles with the cargo on level ground.
    Yes, sure.
    Not up.
    It’s excellent.
    But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
    And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.

    The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially 
outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- 
simply from a property market mostly.
    And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
    The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more
than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
    Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
    But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle 
production, sales deliveries by -- on average <span class="r3">50</span>% a year as far into the future as we can see.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out</span>
<span class="r5">the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.</span>
    In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there 
weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.

And cost of shipping has come down tremendously.

    And now it’s $<span class="r3">3</span>,<span class="r3">500</span>, $<span class="r3">3</span>,<span class="r3">600</span>.

listening because they’re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to add a little bit more context.
    So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we’ve seen over the last two years.

    The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax 
credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each 
of <span class="r3">2023</span>, <span class="r3">2024</span> and <span class="r3">2025</span> through your existing and planned supply chain?
    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
    Do you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while 
also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
    Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well 
positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
