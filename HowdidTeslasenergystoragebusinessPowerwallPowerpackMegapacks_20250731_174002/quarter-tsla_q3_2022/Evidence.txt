[TSLA_Q3_2022] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #83]  Just to continue on **Elon**’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and **storage** deployments in the third quarter.
2. [Sentence #91]  On **energy** profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this **business**, driven primarily by record volumes of our **Megapack** and **Powerwall** products.
3. [Sentence #114]  **Elon** Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
4. [Sentence #123]  **Elon** Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.
5. [Sentence #132]  We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual **growth** rate.
6. [Sentence #146]  **Elon** Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
7. [Sentence #185]  **Elon** Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
8. [Sentence #220]  **Elon** Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable **energy**, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
9. [Sentence #241]  So that also -- we actually see the ****energy** **storage** **business****, stationary **storage**, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
10. [Sentence #410]  **Elon** Musk

And again, this is publicly available information.
