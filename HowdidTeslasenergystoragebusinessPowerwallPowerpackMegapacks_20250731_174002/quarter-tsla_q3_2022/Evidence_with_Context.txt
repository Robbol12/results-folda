[TSLA_Q3_2022] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #241] [PLAN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the 1% point come in.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
     So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
     But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
     And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power.
     So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time.
>>> So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.
     Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
     So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
     And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And we try to model out like, let’s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year.
     Even then, we generate meaningful cash.

2. [Sentence #91] [PLAN]
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
>>> On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
     Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
     Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.
     Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
     Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
     As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
     We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.

3. [Sentence #220] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.
     And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
     Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
     Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
     Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
     And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.

4. [Sentence #83] [UNCERTAIN]
     You’re the ones making it happen.
     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
>>> Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.

5. [Sentence #146] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
     At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
     So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the cars.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
     I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
     And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
     There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.
     Just try one.
     Epic.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
-----
6. [Sentence #132] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

7. [Sentence #185] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
     And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.
     It’s excellent.
     But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
     And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.

8. [Sentence #123] [PLAN]
     Let’s go to the next question.
     The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly.
     And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
     The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
     Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
     But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> Elon Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.
     In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

And cost of shipping has come down tremendously.
     Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000.
     And now it’s $3,500, $3,600.
     It’s that kind of reality.
     We’re seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.
     Elon Musk

There’s more deflation than inflation.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Definitely.
>>> Elon Musk

And again, this is publicly available information.
     Anyone could just Google it.
     And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is making this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they’re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to add a little bit more context.
     So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we’ve seen over the last two years.
     And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
-----
10. [Sentence #114] [PLAN]
     The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?
     Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
     Do you want to add?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
     We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
     Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next question.
     The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly.
