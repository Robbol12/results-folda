[Year Q4] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #86]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) **Elon** Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential **growth** in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
2. [Sentence #166]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) **Elon** Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
3. [Sentence #261]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) **Elon** Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our [indiscernible] a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of 50%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Tesla's Q4 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast.
5. [Sentence #846]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) **Elon** Musk

That is one of the things that limits focus or limits the **growth** rate.
6. [Sentence #904]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) **Elon** Musk

I think we feel very confident about achieving those **targets**, let's say, over a three-year time frame.
7. [Sentence #1000]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) **Elon** Musk

But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries.
8. [Sentence #1162]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Elon** Musk

And then, it's so constrained on mass and volume and **energy**.
9. [Sentence #1340]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Elon**, I guess, my question is around the **Megapack** or your **energy** **business**.
10. [Sentence #1341]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different strategies or it seems like with **Megapack** and **Powerwall**.
11. [Sentence #1345]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) To be clear, we do think that old stationary **storage**, **Powerwall** and **Megapack**, will be -- will transition to an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
12. [Sentence #1373]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I mean, either way, I think our plans are pretty ambitious for **Megapack** this year and **storage** in general.
13. [Sentence #1375]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) But ultimately, I mean, to **Elon**'s point about the **growth** of this **business**, I mean, we need to be growing it faster than the vehicle **business**.
14. [Sentence #1376]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Elon** Musk

And it will naturally grow faster than the vehicle **business** once we can -- yes, the chip constraint, frankly.
15. [Sentence #1388]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Elon** Musk

Research centers.
16. [Sentence #1461]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the **Megapack**, in all your ****energy** **storage** **business****?
17. [Sentence #1567]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So, **energy** **storage** also saw record **growth** and that is continuing to accelerate.
18. [Sentence #1596]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) The **Energy** **business** had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial **storage**.
19. [Sentence #1610]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and **growth** of the **energy** **business**.
20. [Sentence #1765]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next **Megapack** factories?
21. [Sentence #1991]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) And then the rest would go into stationary **storage**, the **Powerwall** and **Megapack**.
22. [Sentence #2065]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The ****energy** **storage** **business**** delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before.
23. [Sentence #2073]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Tesla is currently between two major **growth** waves.
24. [Sentence #2074]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) We're focused on making sure that our next **growth** wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, **energy** **storage**, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
25. [Sentence #2134]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Our ****energy** **storage** **business**** had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%.
26. [Sentence #2270]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) **Elon** Musk

Optimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined.
27. [Sentence #2343]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) **Megapack** continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent **growth** trajectory through '24 and '25.
28. [Sentence #2811]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) **Energy** **storage** deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this resulted in -- but declined sequentially.
29. [Sentence #2812]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) This was a result of higher -- sorry, **growth** came from **Megapack** and **Powerwall**.
30. [Sentence #3187]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) **Elon**, you've talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as sort of broader push to sustainable **energy**.
