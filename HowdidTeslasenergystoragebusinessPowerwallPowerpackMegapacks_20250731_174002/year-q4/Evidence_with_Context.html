    And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
    So, it&#x27;s great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with <span class="r3">4680</span> this quarter and at the
same time that you don&#x27;t really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant 
volume growth this year.
    And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of <span class="r3">4680</span> internally.
    But I&#x27;d be curious to hear you talk about how you think about <span class="r3">4680</span> as being a form factor that your suppliers could 
adopt as well.
    And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does <span class="r3">4680</span> become?
    Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all </span>
<span class="r5">your energy storage business?</span>
    And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    On the <span class="r3">4680</span> as a form factor, yes, we&#x27;ve engaged with a number of our partners or suppliers on the form factor and 
they&#x27;re all working on it.
    And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also 
ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
    And so, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s engaged -- I mean, we&#x27;re engaged because we think it&#x27;s a good form factor there, engaged 
because they think it&#x27;s a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
    To the question about should everything be <span class="r3">4680</span>, it doesn&#x27;t have to be.
    In the end, it&#x27;s about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.

    I would be shocked.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to analyst questions now.
    And the first question comes from Jed from Canaccord.
    Jed, feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question.
    Jed Dorsheimer

Hi.
    Thanks, and congratulations on a great year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon, I guess, my question is around the Megapack or your energy business.</span>
    And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different 
strategies or it seems like with Megapack and Powerwall.
    And I think the Powerwall was answered with <span class="r3">4680</span> and the <span class="r3">2170</span> opening up.
    So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect
for that.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will be -- will transition to an 
iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
    Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
    It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2065</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.
    It&#x27;s really a gem.
    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span class="r3">1.2</span> million units delivered.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The energy storage business delivered nearly </span><span class="r5">15</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours of batteries in </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5">, compared to </span><span class="r5">6.5</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours </span>
<span class="r5">the year before.</span>
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span class="r3">4.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2134</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The key among them being total cost of ownership.
    This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.
    We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support 
the overall demand.
    There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market.
    First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y,
which means an immediate reduction of $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">500</span> at the time of purchase to the end customer.
    Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model <span class="r3">3</span> and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.
    Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by </span>
<span class="r5">more than </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">%.</span>
    This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our 
Megafactory in Lathrop.
    I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.
    Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our 
fleet grows.
    As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
    For <span class="r3">2024</span>, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing 
investments in our future growth initiatives.
    Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for <span class="r3">2024</span> to be in excess of $<span class="r3">10</span> billion.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2812</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span class="r3">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.
    And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to market, less premium competitors.
    Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this resulted in -- but declined sequentially.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.</span>
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span class="r3">50</span>% growth in 
deployments year over year in <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">1596</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Note that in <span class="r3">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span class="r3">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span class="r3">3</span>.
    Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with 
the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and </span>
<span class="r5">commercial storage.</span>
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span class="r3">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
    Second, on cost reduction, we&#x27;re holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead 
efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
    In particular, we&#x27;re accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where 
efficiencies are the highest.
    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">7</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">1567</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span class="r3">4680</span> cells reached <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span class="r3">4680</span> cells by another <span class="r3">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
    So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
    And we&#x27;ve got an amazing plan for making the <span class="r3">4680</span> cell low-cost and high energy density.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.</span>
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
    So you have those three things, you can convert all of it to a fully sustainable situation many times over, 
actually.
    So, I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and our goal
at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible.
    So yeah, so we were obviously ramping up Megapack production.
    And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our - the goal output.
    So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry&#x27;s best operating margins.

Hi.
    Thanks, and congratulations on a great year.

for that.

    Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
    It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.
    So iron is.
    So that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of iron on earth as is a ridiculous amount of lithium.
    So, you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.
    And like I said, with manganese is like a wildcard, manganese.
    And I should say like we did short-change the energy business last year and that vehicle took priority over the 
energy side.

    If you were to become demand limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high
industry margins to grow units and share?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    To be clear, the <span class="r3">1.8</span> million is not cell supply limited.
    And I mean, we did address that number earlier in the call if you want to answer.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It&#x27;s roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that.
    And this <span class="r3">1.8</span> million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack.</span>
    So, yes, so true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s have the final question from Adam Jonas.
    Adam Jonas

Hi.
    Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco?
    I mean, you only have like $<span class="r3">4.5</span> billion of receivables.
    It&#x27;s basically nothing compared to other big auto companies.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span class="r3">4.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full </span>
<span class="r5">self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.</span>
    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span class="r3">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span class="r3">400</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> vehicles in North America.
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle 
controls.

    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you.
    The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
    And just a brief update from the business perspective.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through </span><span class="r5">&#x27;24 and &#x27;25</span><span class="r5">.</span>
    We want to thank all of our partners who&#x27;ve put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical 
infrastructure around the world.
    And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong <span class="r3">2023</span> execution.
    Lathrop continues to ramp through <span class="r3">2024</span> with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from <span class="r3">20</span>

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is from Siddharth, what are the preliminary results and return on investment of your 
ads and education campaign?
    Given that many people still lack awareness that Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price 
of $<span class="r3">45</span>,<span class="r3">000</span>, will you expand educational ads?
    Unidentified Company Representative

As Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really address the affordability issue.

    Like I said, over time, it will make sense to have a consistent form factor.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    It makes sense.
    And then one additional, maybe qualitative question on capacity expansion.
    You&#x27;ve mentioned in the past, I mean, access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings that are 
sufficiently qualified is another.
    Have you run up against any issues on that front that would potentially limit your growth in any way?
    Thanks.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">That is one of the things that limits focus or limits the growth rate.</span>
    It doesn&#x27;t limit the ultimate size, but it limits the growth rate, which is what&#x27;s the rate of which we can onboard 
great people and get them trained in the right areas.
    You usually can&#x27;t like instantaneously -- if you&#x27;ve got a factory that has <span class="r3">20</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> employees, you can&#x27;t just hire 
<span class="r3">20</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> people instantly.
    They&#x27;ve got -- they’re usually doing something else.
    So they&#x27;ve got to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country.
    And so there&#x27;s a certain amount of time required for that.
    I mean, that said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of <span class="r3">50</span>% per year for many years to come.
    And at least, I&#x27;d like to -- yes, at least, look forward to many -- for many years to come.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span class="r5">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It&#x27;s definitely aligned with our mission to transition to sustainable -- accelerate the transition to sustainable 
energy.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think it really becomes quite a compelling solution to the consumer where you integrate the electric vehicles 
charging, solar, energy storage, hot water, HVAC in a very tight compact package that also looks good.
    It just doesn&#x27;t exist.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, the integration of those systems in a house are no different than the integration of those systems in a 
vehicle.
    The only difference is -- we do it all in the vehicle.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">And then, it&#x27;s so constrained on mass and volume and energy.</span>
    It&#x27;s like -- you get the house…

Andrew Baglino

Kind of easy problem.
    But obviously, those systems are all just disparate and what we&#x27;ve been doing with Powerwall and charging solar is 
integrating them more and more.
    The next logical step is obviously HVAC and water and heating.
    So we will do that and we will integrate it probably better than anyone has.
    But as you said, we have a lot of stuff on our plate.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And system integration too, with like phone, everything and the car can -- like the house can just heat and cool 
things because those are coming home type of thing.

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to analyst questions now.
    And the first question comes from Jed from Canaccord.
    Jed, feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question.
    Jed Dorsheimer

Hi.
    Thanks, and congratulations on a great year.
    Elon, I guess, my question is around the Megapack or your energy business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different </span>
<span class="r5">strategies or it seems like with Megapack and Powerwall.</span>
    And I think the Powerwall was answered with <span class="r3">4680</span> and the <span class="r3">2170</span> opening up.
    So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect
for that.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will be -- will transition to an 
iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
    Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
    It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.
    So iron is.

    It&#x27;s just -- we -- if we&#x27;re simply -- we&#x27;re able to respond to demand, it might grow by like <span class="r3">200</span>% or <span class="r3">300</span>% or 
something as opposed to sort of <span class="r3">50</span>% or so.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, I think it&#x27;s exactly that.
    I mean, it&#x27;s a question of does it double, triple, quadruple?
    I mean, either way, I think our plans are pretty ambitious for Megapack this year and storage in general.
    The exact amount of growth is hard to know.
    But ultimately, I mean, to Elon&#x27;s point about the growth of this business, I mean, we need to be growing it faster 
than the vehicle business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">And it will naturally grow faster than the vehicle business once we can -- yes, the chip constraint, frankly.</span>
    So, it will grow like stars  basically on the road, it needs to.
    And our primary mission is to accelerate sustainable energy.
    That&#x27;s always been our primary mission and we&#x27;re trying to stay true to that.

    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r3">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass </span>
<span class="r5">Roof.</span>
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r3">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    That&#x27;s great Elon.
    Like just to emphasize on that, we&#x27;ve started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA,
general assembly, body shops.
    We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 
<span class="r3">2024</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r5">Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?</span>
    How many are needed on each continent?
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s a good question.
    It&#x27;s not something we -- I think we&#x27;ll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we&#x27;re 
thinking about very carefully.
    I really kind of like what is the fastest path to <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span>-gigawatt-hours a year of production.
    And you&#x27;ll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Okay.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span class="r3">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it
will continue to get better from here.
    As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full 
autonomy in the future.
    And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to market, less premium competitors.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this resulted in -- but declined sequentially.</span>
    This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span class="r3">50</span>% growth in 
deployments year over year in <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.

    Great.
    Alrighty.
    And our last question will be coming from Dan Levy at Barclays.
    Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Great.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon, you&#x27;ve talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as sort of broader push to</span>
<span class="r5">sustainable energy.</span>
    I know we&#x27;ve heard a lot about President Trump&#x27;s plans to reverse the EV mandate.
    And I think there&#x27;s a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the U.S.
    So, what would be your view on the right policy in the U.S., given your comments in the past that the need to push 
for sustainable transport?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable.
    I&#x27;m highly confident all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it&#x27;s simply -- it can 
be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine or one could 
have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine.
    Like even if you&#x27;ve been the biggest advocate on Earth, like of the way on these newfangled car automobiles, you 
can&#x27;t stop the advent of automobile.
    It&#x27;s going to happen.

    I mean is that something that&#x27;s feasible for you guys to execute on a consistent basis a level of capacity building 
that large?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I mean, I think…

Elon Musk

We&#x27;re having for more than <span class="r3">30</span>%, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I think they&#x27;re not -- I&#x27;m not sure the math that you&#x27;ve done, but I think our internal plans are faster.
    And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the <span class="r3">10</span>-K, but back to the growth 
rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support 
that growth.
    So that helps.
    And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to 
continue to fund additional factory.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that </span>
<span class="r5">Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.</span>

    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.

    How do you organize the R&amp;D efforts so that you can start talking about all these new products?
    Is there like an incubator or some type of thing like that?

    Elon Musk

Well, we don&#x27;t have incubators.
    Andrew Baglino

Or research centers.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Research centers.</span>
    Andrew Baglino

We work on things that go into our products.
    Elon Musk

Yes, we&#x27;re like this is a useful product that the world really needs.
    And we’re just like let’s make this thing, design it up and iterate fast and then figure out how to make this at 
scale at a reasonable price.
    That last part is the super hard part.
    Many times, we&#x27;ve said prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    We could work out that as a way of prototypes, but what&#x27;s the point of that?
    Like you actually have to reach scale production and have cash and exceed cash out.

    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
    It&#x27;s definitely the smart move.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Siddharth.
    What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting 
there?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Optimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the </span>
<span class="r5">potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined.</span>
    When you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita.
    But what if there&#x27;s no limit to capita?
    There&#x27;s no limit to the economy.
    And the technologies that we&#x27;ve -- AI technologies that we&#x27;ve developed for the car translate quite well to a 
humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on four wheels.
    Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world.
    It&#x27;s just a four-wheeled robot.
    So Optimus is a humanoid robot with arms and legs.

    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span class="r3">4.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.</span>
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full 
self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span class="r3">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span class="r3">400</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> vehicles in North America.
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle

<span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">166</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r3">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r3">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r3">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> </span>
<span class="r5">and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.</span>
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
    So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, 
a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
    Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.

And also on working capital.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.

    If you do it right, you basically have no effect on your payload or almost nothing, and you can have a long-range 
truck.
    I mean, Jerome, do you want to add to that?
    Jerome Guillen

I agree there.
    And we see also an increase on the regionalization of trucks.
    And I think it will be perfect.
    The Tesla Semi will be perfect for it, yes.
    And I&#x27;m very -- I&#x27;m looking forward to having some additional ones on the road very soon.

<span class="r5">But basically, we do not see any issues with creating a compelling long-range truck with batteries.</span>
    The problem is cell supply; cell supply is the only thing.

It&#x27;s going to be awesome.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    And unfortunately, that&#x27;s all the time we have today.
    So, thanks for all of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about three months.

    Please go ahead.

Thank you very much.
    My first question is about your in-house cell manufacturing efforts.
    So in addition to building up capacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by 
about <span class="r3">50</span>%, boost the range by about <span class="r3">50</span>% over a number of years.
    So wanted to know if your initial efforts are trending in that direction?
    What is, sort, of like the timeline to achieve these goals?
    And maybe related to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model, 
eventually?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let&#x27;s say, over a three-year time frame.</span>
    I don&#x27;t know it grew -- it&#x27;s not like year one.
    So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room.
    But for three or four years, I’d say.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    We put together the trajectory in the Battery Day, and we&#x27;re on that trajectory still.
    I think that&#x27;s probably the best reference for the cost trajectory that we are on.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
