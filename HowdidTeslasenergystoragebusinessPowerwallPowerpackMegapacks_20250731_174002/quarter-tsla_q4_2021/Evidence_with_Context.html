    And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
    So, it&#x27;s great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with <span class="r3">4680</span> this quarter and at the
same time that you don&#x27;t really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant 
volume growth this year.
    And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of <span class="r3">4680</span> internally.
    But I&#x27;d be curious to hear you talk about how you think about <span class="r3">4680</span> as being a form factor that your suppliers could 
adopt as well.
    And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does <span class="r3">4680</span> become?
    Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all </span>
<span class="r5">your energy storage business?</span>
    And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    On the <span class="r3">4680</span> as a form factor, yes, we&#x27;ve engaged with a number of our partners or suppliers on the form factor and 
they&#x27;re all working on it.
    And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also 
ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
    And so, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s engaged -- I mean, we&#x27;re engaged because we think it&#x27;s a good form factor there, engaged 
because they think it&#x27;s a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
    To the question about should everything be <span class="r3">4680</span>, it doesn&#x27;t have to be.
    In the end, it&#x27;s about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.

    Let&#x27;s go to analyst questions now.
    And the first question comes from Jed from Canaccord.
    Jed, feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question.
    Jed Dorsheimer

Hi.
    Thanks, and congratulations on a great year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon, I guess, my question is around the Megapack or your energy business.</span>
    And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different 
strategies or it seems like with Megapack and Powerwall.
    And I think the Powerwall was answered with <span class="r3">4680</span> and the <span class="r3">2170</span> opening up.
    So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect
for that.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will be -- will transition to an 
iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
    Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
    It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.

    Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
    It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.
    So iron is.
    So that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of iron on earth as is a ridiculous amount of lithium.
    So, you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.
    And like I said, with manganese is like a wildcard, manganese.
    And I should say like we did short-change the energy business last year and that vehicle took priority over the 
energy side.

    It&#x27;s definitely aligned with our mission to transition to sustainable -- accelerate the transition to sustainable 
energy.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think it really becomes quite a compelling solution to the consumer where you integrate the electric vehicles 
charging, solar, energy storage, hot water, HVAC in a very tight compact package that also looks good.
    It just doesn&#x27;t exist.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, the integration of those systems in a house are no different than the integration of those systems in a 
vehicle.
    The only difference is -- we do it all in the vehicle.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">And then, it&#x27;s so constrained on mass and volume and energy.</span>
    It&#x27;s like -- you get the house…

Andrew Baglino

Kind of easy problem.
    But obviously, those systems are all just disparate and what we&#x27;ve been doing with Powerwall and charging solar is 
integrating them more and more.
    The next logical step is obviously HVAC and water and heating.
    So we will do that and we will integrate it probably better than anyone has.
    But as you said, we have a lot of stuff on our plate.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And system integration too, with like phone, everything and the car can -- like the house can just heat and cool 
things because those are coming home type of thing.

Yes.

    The exact amount of growth is hard to know.
    But ultimately, I mean, to Elon&#x27;s point about the growth of this business, I mean, we need to be growing it faster

    Andrew Baglino

We work on things that go into our products.
    Elon Musk

Yes, we&#x27;re like this is a useful product that the world really needs.
    And we’re just like let’s make this thing, design it up and iterate fast and then figure out how to make this at 
scale at a reasonable price.
    That last part is the super hard part.
    Many times, we&#x27;ve said prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    We could work out that as a way of prototypes, but what&#x27;s the point of that?
    Like you actually have to reach scale production and have cash and exceed cash out.

    The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs and excess expedites was just over $<span class="r3">700</span> million 
in the quarter.
    Our free cash flows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $<span class="r3">2.8</span> billion, despite increased CapEx.
    In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have been retiring legacy and high interest 
debt.
    Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market for product-specific financing.
    As we look forward, and we expect <span class="r3">2022</span> to be another significant and exciting year for the Company.
    We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above <span class="r3">50</span>%, as Elon mentioned, and our plans show that this is 
actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories.
    For quite some time now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supply and 
logistics.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As Elon mentioned as well, from what we&#x27;re seeing, the pace of growth in </span><span class="r5">2022</span><span class="r5"> will again be determined by supply </span>
<span class="r5">chain and logistics, which is quite difficult for us to forecast.</span>
    Despite these constraints, it&#x27;s important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we are prepared once
limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.
    This will result in higher fixed and semi-variable costs in the near term, in addition to the usual inefficiencies 
as we ramp a new factory.
    We are also seeing inflation and rising commodity prices, which we expect to continue to put pressure on our costs.
    How this specifically impacts gross margins in the near term is uncertain, given a mix of both tailwinds and 
headwinds.
    However, we do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating 
leverage.
    Over a longer-term horizon, we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins, though.
    From the hardware side, we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce 
cost.
