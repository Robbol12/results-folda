[TSLA_Q4_2021] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #451] [PLAN]
     And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
     So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter and at the same time that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
     And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally.
     But I'd be curious to hear you talk about how you think about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well.
     And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does 4680 become?
     Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
>>> Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business?
     And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners or suppliers on the form factor and they're all working on it.
     And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
     And so, that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
     To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.
     In the end, it's about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.

     I would be shocked.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to analyst questions now.
     And the first question comes from Jed from Canaccord.
     Jed, feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question.
     Jed Dorsheimer

Hi.
     Thanks, and congratulations on a great year.
>>> Elon, I guess, my question is around the Megapack or your energy business.
     And so, as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, you have two different strategies or it seems like with Megapack and Powerwall.
     And I think the Powerwall was answered with 4680 and the 2170 opening up.
     So, I was wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect for that.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will be -- will transition to an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system.
     Manganese is also -- could be part of the future, but primarily iron.
     It just comes down -- iron nickel -- we need something that is formed in a star before a supernova, ideally.

     So iron is.
     So that's because there's a ridiculous amount of iron on earth as is a ridiculous amount of lithium.
     So, you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.
     And like I said, with manganese is like a wildcard, manganese.
     And I should say like we did short-change the energy business last year and that vehicle took priority over the energy side.

     It's definitely aligned with our mission to transition to sustainable -- accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think it really becomes quite a compelling solution to the consumer where you integrate the electric vehicles charging, solar, energy storage, hot water, HVAC in a very tight compact package that also looks good.
     It just doesn't exist.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean, the integration of those systems in a house are no different than the integration of those systems in a vehicle.
     The only difference is -- we do it all in the vehicle.
>>> Elon Musk

And then, it's so constrained on mass and volume and energy.
     It's like -- you get the house…

Andrew Baglino

Kind of easy problem.
     But obviously, those systems are all just disparate and what we've been doing with Powerwall and charging solar is integrating them more and more.
     The next logical step is obviously HVAC and water and heating.
     So we will do that and we will integrate it probably better than anyone has.
     But as you said, we have a lot of stuff on our plate.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And system integration too, with like phone, everything and the car can -- like the house can just heat and cool things because those are coming home type of thing.

     It's just -- we -- if we're simply -- we're able to respond to demand, it might grow by like 200% or 300% or something as opposed to sort of 50% or so.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, I think it's exactly that.
     I mean, it's a question of does it double, triple, quadruple?
     I mean, either way, I think our plans are pretty ambitious for Megapack this year and storage in general.
     The exact amount of growth is hard to know.
     But ultimately, I mean, to Elon's point about the growth of this business, I mean, we need to be growing it faster than the vehicle business.
>>> Elon Musk

And it will naturally grow faster than the vehicle business once we can -- yes, the chip constraint, frankly.
     So, it will grow like stars [ph] basically on the road, it needs to.
     And our primary mission is to accelerate sustainable energy.
     That's always been our primary mission and we're trying to stay true to that.
     Martin Viecha

The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
     Ben Kallo

I was wondering on the R&D front because like you said, you have so many [indiscernible].
     How do you organize the R&D efforts so that you can start talking about all these new products?
     Is there like an incubator or some type of thing like that?

     Ben Kallo

I was wondering on the R&D front because like you said, you have so many [indiscernible].
     How do you organize the R&D efforts so that you can start talking about all these new products?
     Is there like an incubator or some type of thing like that?
     But just structurally, I'm curious about that.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Well, we don't have incubators.
     Andrew Baglino

Or research centers.
>>> Elon Musk

Research centers.
     Andrew Baglino

We work on things that go into our products.
     Elon Musk

Yes, we're like this is a useful product that the world really needs.
     And we’re just like let’s make this thing, design it up and iterate fast and then figure out how to make this at scale at a reasonable price.
     That last part is the super hard part.
     Many times, we've said prototypes are easy, production is hard.
     We could work out that as a way of prototypes, but what's the point of that?
     Like you actually have to reach scale production and have cash and exceed cash out.

10. [Sentence #111] [PLAN]
     The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs and excess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.
     Our free cash flows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion, despite increased CapEx.
     In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have been retiring legacy and high interest debt.
     Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market for product-specific financing.
     As we look forward, and we expect 2022 to be another significant and exciting year for the Company.
     We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plans show that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories.
     For quite some time now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supply and logistics.
>>> As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 will again be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difficult for us to forecast.
     Despite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we are prepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.
     This will result in higher fixed and semi-variable costs in the near term, in addition to the usual inefficiencies as we ramp a new factory.
     We are also seeing inflation and rising commodity prices, which we expect to continue to put pressure on our costs.
     How this specifically impacts gross margins in the near term is uncertain, given a mix of both tailwinds and headwinds.
     However, we do expect to continue to see stronger operating margins as we grow our volumes and improve operating leverage.
     Over a longer-term horizon, we are quite optimistic about the expansion of margins, though.
     From the hardware side, we are aggressively driving manufacturing innovations and operational efficiency to reduce cost.
