    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make 
compelling EVs.
    So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.
    And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more 
difficult for Tesla.
    We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.
    And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully 
electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.
    Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.</span>
    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
    This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- 
not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.

<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">47</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
    And we expect to have Optimus production Version <span class="r3">1</span> in limited production starting early next year.
    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span class="r3">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span class="r3">2</span> of Optimus.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.</span>
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
    Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the 
fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.

    Ben Kallo

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think
about the overall segments longer term?
    And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below <span class="r3">50</span>% of your overall revenue?
    And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware.
    Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward 
customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars?
    Thanks.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, I mean, as I&#x27;ve said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that </span>
<span class="r5">Tesla combined.</span>
    So, it&#x27;s simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything 
you ask of it.
    I think everyone on earth is going to want one.
    There&#x27;s <span class="r3">8</span> billion people on earth, so it&#x27;s <span class="r3">8</span> billion right there.
    Then you&#x27;ve got, all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more.
    So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of <span class="r3">20</span> billion units.
    And Tesla is -- that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, 
which these other companies are not.
    And we&#x27;ve got a lot of experience -- with the most experienced with the world leaders in real world AI.

    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I would say something.
    Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers.
    Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who 
had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging.
    We&#x27;ve spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy.
    We&#x27;re not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our 
options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we&#x27;ll move on to the next </span>
<span class="r5">one.</span>
    What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
    Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
    I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.
    Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.
    So it doesn&#x27;t make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
    So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.
    However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.

    It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved.
    Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
    Now let&#x27;s go to investor questions.
    The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">With respect to Roadster, we&#x27;ve completed most of the engineering.</span>
    And I think there&#x27;s still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next 
year.
    It will be something special, like the whole thing <span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span>.
    Travis Axelrod

Fantastic.
    The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we&#x27;ve already covered.
    So we&#x27;ll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
    Elon Musk

I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full 
self-driving.
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.

    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r3">300</span> miles on a single

    And this relates a little bit to the last one that was asked.
    Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI and I recognize Tesla&#x27;s opportunity to do some great things with the 
technology.
    But there are some concerns I have about Tesla&#x27;s commercialization and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to ask about 
specifically.
    There were some news stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that 
were destined for Tesla instead to xAI or perhaps it was to X, I&#x27;m not sure.
    And similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area, and you
noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but 
some of them weren&#x27;t at Tesla, they were instead at xAI or perhaps even X again.
    So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&amp;D, your AI engineers, how do you make 
allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you&#x27;re doing it in a
way that really benefits them?
    Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, I mean, I think you&#x27;re referring to a very -- like an old article, regarding GPUs.</span>
    I think that&#x27;s like <span class="r3">6</span> or <span class="r3">7</span> months old.
    At Tesla, we had no place to try them on, so it would&#x27;ve been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to
order H100 and have no place to try them on.
    So it was just -- there was -- this wasn&#x27;t a, let&#x27;s pick xAI of Tesla.
    There&#x27;s -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full.
    There was no place to actually put them.
    The -- we&#x27;ve been working <span class="r3">24</span>/<span class="r3">7</span> to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas.
    That South extension is what will house <span class="r3">50</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> H100s and we&#x27;re beginning to move the H100 server racks into place 
there.
