[TSLA_Q4_2022] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #76] [PLAN]
     Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.
     Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
     First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
     Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories.
     Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.
     Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years.
     These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
>>> The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage.
     While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
     As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
     There are three key points I wanted to make here.
     First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
     Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
     In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where efficiencies are the highest.
     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.

2. [Sentence #47] [PLAN]
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
     Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
     So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
     Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
     So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
     And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low-cost and high energy density.
>>> So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
     That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time.
     So you have those three things, you can convert all of it to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually.
     So, I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible.
     So yeah, so we were obviously ramping up Megapack production.
     And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our - the goal output.
     So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
     We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins.

3. [Sentence #471] [UNCERTAIN]
     If you were to become demand limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high industry margins to grow units and share?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     To be clear, the 1.8 million is not cell supply limited.
     And I mean, we did address that number earlier in the call if you want to answer.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It's roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that.
     And this 1.8 million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more.
>>> And then the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack.
     So, yes, so true.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's have the final question from Adam Jonas.
     Adam Jonas

Hi.
     Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco?
     I mean, you only have like $4.5 billion of receivables.
     It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies.
-----
4. [Sentence #90] [PLAN]
     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
     This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
     As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
     In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
     Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
>>> This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
-----
5. [Sentence #245] [UNCERTAIN]
     That's great Elon.
     Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
     How many are needed on each continent?
     Elon Musk

It's a good question.
     It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully.
     I really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000-gigawatt-hours a year of production.
     And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Okay.
-----
6. [Sentence #243] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
     Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
     I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
>>> Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
     The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
-----
8. [Sentence #64] [PLAN]
     And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1st Investor Day.
     And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year.
     Congratulations, guys.
     Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
     And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
>>> So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla.
     I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.
     On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading.
     Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further.
     For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
     Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.
     Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
     First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.

9. [Sentence #511] [PLAN]
     Like, if we see deflation, and I think we are seeing deflation then you would add the deflation number to the 'risk-free rate' from the Fed.
     And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting to exceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't just put your money in a savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500, if the S&P 500 is variable and the bank interest rate is not?
     This is -- so basically, the Fed is the risk of crushing the value of all equities, which is quite a serious, danger.
     Adam Jonas

Thanks Elon.
     And just a follow-up, I don't want to steal thunder from March 1st and in Austin, but how close are we to that step change improvement in BoM cost where you could sell an EV for under $25,000 or $30,000 and actually generate a profit, that kind of real moving assembly line moment in manufacturing?
     Again, I don't want to steal the thunder but just if you wanted to kind of wrap-up with thoughts there that would be helpful.
     Thanks Elon.
>>> Elon Musk

I mean, I'd love to answer -- I'll probably be asking the same question, but we would be jumping the gun on future announcements.
     Martin Viecha

Fantastic.
     Thank you very much, everyone, for all your good questions.
     And we will see you again in three months' time.
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
-----
10. [Sentence #493] [PLAN]
     And so we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned.
     So basically, it's a vehicle to support vehicle sales, make sure customers have access.
     I do think there's opportunity here to continue to grow this.
     We are growing it slowly here.
     It is a consumer of cash, so we're being cautious on how we do that.
     But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here.
     And I think we'll have to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to how much we ramp it up versus ramp it back.
>>> Elon Musk

I think if we see a severe recession this year, which like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severe recessions, cash is king big time, because it's in such short supply.
     So we want to be cautious about using cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars.
     I feel we're in a very strong position to get through a recession, because we really don't have any debt.
     And we've got over $20 billion of cash, which is great.
     The cash is earning a ridiculous return, a good return.
     So it's like nontrivial.
     And the interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount.
     And I've made this point on Twitter a few times.
