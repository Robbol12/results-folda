    Absolutely agree.
    Yes.

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the Megapack.

    Just like cigarettes and alcohol.
    Just like fruits and vegetables.
    It’s just common sense.
    And on the plus side, I am not suggesting anyone be complacent.
    But sustainable energy, renewable energy, will be sold.
    It is being sold, but it matters how fast we sell this and if we sell it faster, that’s better for the world.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, </span>
<span class="r5">zero.</span>
    I want to be clear, zero.
    I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based, lithium-ion cells.
    I will say, lithium-ion, people think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells.
    It’s more like <span class="r3">1</span>% to <span class="r3">2</span>% of the cell is lithium.
    The main part of the cell is the cathode.
    The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode.
    For high energy cells, like, for example, what we use in most Teslas, have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which 
have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.

Elon Musk

Sorry about that.

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">So, yeah, so it’s basically saying that the, like, right now people think of Tesla has -- a lot of people think Tesla is</span>
<span class="r5">a car company or perhaps an energy company.</span>
    I think long-term people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy 
company.
    I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world and so we appear to be 
able to do things with Self-Driving that others cannot.
    So and if you look at the evolution of what technologies we have developed, we developed them in order to solve the 
problem of Self-Driving.
    So we couldn’t find a powerful enough neural net computer, so we designed and built our own.
    The software out there was really quite primitive for this task and so we built a team from scratch and have been 
developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world.
    And then it sort of makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a 
neural net computer, our brain.
    Our brain is a neural net computer.

    We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And I had a quick follow-up on – maybe, Zach, for you on your Energy business.
    So I understand like the negative gross margin with Solar Roof ran.
    But I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the Storage business and where are you --
what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business?
    I guess it’s going to grow in the mix in coming years, so it’s important for long-term modeling.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are seeing a lot of…</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">We are aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicles.</span>
    But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than storage.
    So we are already are at good margins with the Powerwall, but some additional work is needed for the Megapack to 
achieve good margins.
    Yes, Drew, what do you think?

    This is a recipe for disaster.
    So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the local level at the house.
    In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level so that solar and wind, which are 
the main forms of renewable electricity can be -- that electricity can be stored because sometimes the wind doesn’t 
blow.
    Sometimes it blows a lot.
    Sometimes it blows too much and at times it doesn’t blow enough.
    But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide the energy to the grid as needed.
    The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine at night and sometimes it is very cloudy.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so by having battery storage power with solar and wind, this gives the long-term solution to a stable energy </span>
<span class="r5">future, and as I said, especially each both at the local level and at the utility level.</span>
    If it doesn’t occur at the local level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines, in 
power plants, as they would have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place.
    They will have to increase the size of the substations.
    It’s a nightmare.
    This must occur.
    There must be solar plus battery.
    It’s the only way.
    So, yeah.

    Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors.
    The first question is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claim that lithium ion is unsuited to 
long-term storage at scale due to vampire drain.
    Could <span class="r3">4680</span> cells address this limitation?
    Is the limitation even relevant for changing the energy equation?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Just let me jump in on the vampire drain.
    That’s definitely not the issue.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Good lithium ion cell self-discharges less than </span><span class="r5">0.001</span><span class="r5">% of its energy per day, so the vampire drain is maybe not…</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Myth.</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Elon Musk

As mythical as vampires.
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    I think the challenge with seasonal storage is, your value proposition drops from hundreds of utile  full cycles per
year to less than maybe <span class="r3">10</span> or less maybe even less than five cycles per year.
    So it’s just a different type of technology altogether that would make sense, given that it’s more than an order of 
magnitude different use case.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    We have got a long way to go before we are dealing with seasonal technology issues.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">416</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    But as we have matured the process equipment, we have gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And basically, this is just a guess because we don’t know for sure, but it appears as though we are about <span class="r3">12</span>, 
probably, not more than <span class="r3">18</span> months away from volume production of the <span class="r3">4680</span>.
    Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our cell supply partners ramp up their supply as much as 
possible.
    So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers.
    It is in conjunction with suppliers.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">So we want to be super clear about that.</span>
    This is not about replacing suppliers.
    It is about supplementing suppliers.
    So -- and we have a very strong partnership with JBL, with Panasonic and LG.
    And we would -- our request to our strategic partners for cell supply is, please supply us – please supply us with 
as much as you possibly can.
    Provided the price is affordable, we will buy everything that they can make.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Yes.
