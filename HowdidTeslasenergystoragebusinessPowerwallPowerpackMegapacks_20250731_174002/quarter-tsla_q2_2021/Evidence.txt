Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla First Quarter 2021 Results and Q&A Webcast.
2. [Sentence #126]  **Elon** Musk

So, yeah, so it’s basically saying that the, like, right now people think of Tesla has -- a lot of people think Tesla is a car company or perhaps an **energy** company.
3. [Sentence #216]  And so by having battery **storage** power with solar and wind, this gives the long-term solution to a stable **energy** future, and as I said, especially each both at the local level and at the utility level.
4. [Sentence #277]  Good lithium ion cell self-discharges less than 0.001% of its **energy** per day, so the vampire drain is maybe not…

**Elon** Musk

Myth.
5. [Sentence #329]  **Elon** Musk

There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the **energy** **storage** problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.
6. [Sentence #416]  **Elon** Musk

So we want to be super clear about that.
7. [Sentence #434]  We are seeing a lot of…

**Elon** Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in **storage** as in vehicles.
8. [Sentence #436]  So we are already are at good margins with the **Powerwall**, but some additional work is needed for the **Megapack** to achieve good margins.
9. [Sentence #445]  We have been producing **Powerwall** 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but **Megapack** has more room to go to achieve our **targets**.
10. [Sentence #446]  **Elon** Musk

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the **Megapack**.
