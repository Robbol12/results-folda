this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

<span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">116</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    I think it&#x27;s reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core
business.
    On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from <span class="r3">18.7</span>% to <span class="r3">23.7</span>%, with some of 
our programs achieving greater than <span class="r3">25</span>% gross margin.
    Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r3">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r3">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.
    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and </span>
<span class="r5">Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.</span>
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r3">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r3">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r3">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r3">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r3">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
    As were previous investments in Model <span class="r3">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span class="r3">2021</span> and <span class="r3">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r3">2</span> billion to $<span class="r3">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">138</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r3">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r3">500</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
    While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it&#x27;s possible with tight execution across the company.
    So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
    I&#x27;ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few 
comments.
    RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
    First, I&#x27;d like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
    Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we&#x27;re poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and 
solar.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as </span>
<span class="r5">the product reaches full capacity.</span>
    We have more demand than supply through <span class="r3">2021</span> and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand 
across the globe through <span class="r3">2023</span> and beyond.
    Our order book is rapidly filling up through <span class="r3">2023</span> in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
    Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations 
across the globe.
    This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
    This is true for standalone storage as well.
    Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced 
real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.
    For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and 
backup home generation.

    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
    Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation 
process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale </span>
<span class="r5">while reducing cost to maximize profitability.</span>
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
    The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start <span class="r3">4680</span> cell production at Giga Berlin at 
the same time as vehicle production?
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">302</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery 
capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We&#x27;re ramping up stationary storage a lot.
    So I mean, it&#x27;s approximately doubling as we expect, it&#x27;s approximately double next year.
    So that&#x27;s pretty good.
    And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.
    Drew Baglino

And approximately doubling it this year, too.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the growth...</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, yes, yes.</span>
    I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we&#x27;ll need to start 
turning Jupiter into cells.
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard.
    Delays happen.
    What contingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal 
cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and 
Texas?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So I think it&#x27;s -- we&#x27;re trying to derisk to <span class="r3">2021</span> so that there&#x27;s almost no dependency on our internal cell 
production.
    It&#x27;s very, very small.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">608</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think you&#x27;re probably right about that.
    I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;re already seeing this in Australia, where we&#x27;re seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing 
grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid 
operator.
    So you&#x27;re seeing this trend happening across the globe.
    And it&#x27;s going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those </span><span class="r5">2</span><span class="r5"> working together in tandem and the software </span>
<span class="r5">layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware </span>
<span class="r5">platform and software together.</span>
    RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like 
we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
    So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we&#x27;re continuing to make money off of that power plant.
    Philippe Houchois

Okay.
    Thank you.
    And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration 
approach.
    It&#x27;s very interesting.
    And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla 
Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?

    Martin Viecha

Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla&#x27;s third quarter <span class="r3">2020</span> Q&amp;A webcast.
    I&#x27;m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.

    For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and 
backup home generation.
    We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer 
orders.
    We&#x27;re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are 
providing services back to the grid when they don&#x27;t need to consume energy or have backup power.
    This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r3">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
