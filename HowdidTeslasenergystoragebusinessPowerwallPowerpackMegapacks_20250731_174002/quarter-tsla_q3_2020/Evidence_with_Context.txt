[TSLA_Q3_2020] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #116] [PLAN]
     I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business.
     On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin.
     Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
     We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
     We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.
     We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
>>> In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.

2. [Sentence #138] [PLAN]
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
     So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
     I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
     RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
     First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
     Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar.
>>> Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
     We have more demand than supply through 2021 and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond.
     Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
     Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe.
     This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
     This is true for standalone storage as well.
     Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.
     For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.

4. [Sentence #158] [PILOT]
     As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.
     We're using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company.
     Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
     We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
     We're pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation.
     Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
     Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
>>> In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
     I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
     And let's begin with questions from say.com.
     The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production?
     Can Tesla share more information on what products you'll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Drew, do you want to take that?
-----
5. [Sentence #302] [PLAN]
     The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We're ramping up stationary storage a lot.
     So I mean, it's approximately doubling as we expect, it's approximately double next year.
     So that's pretty good.
     And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.
     Drew Baglino

And approximately doubling it this year, too.
>>> So the growth...

Elon Musk

Yes, yes, yes.
     I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells.
     Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard.
     Delays happen.
     What contingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and Texas?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So I think it's -- we're trying to derisk to 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on our internal cell production.
     It's very, very small.

6. [Sentence #608] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think you're probably right about that.
     I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid operator.
     So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe.
     And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
>>> So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those 2 working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.
     RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
     So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we're continuing to make money off of that power plant.
     Philippe Houchois

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration approach.
     It's very interesting.
     And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?

     For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.
     We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders.
     We're just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are providing services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.
     This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
     In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after tax incentives, which is the lowest in the industry.
     We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales and marketing.
     As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.
