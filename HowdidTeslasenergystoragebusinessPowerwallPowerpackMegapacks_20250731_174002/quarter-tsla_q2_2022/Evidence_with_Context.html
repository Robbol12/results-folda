    You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
    On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to <span class="r3">27.9</span>%.
    The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and 
factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
    Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, 
which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
    While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign 
exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and 
logistics.
    The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit 
economics.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to </span>
<span class="r6">some extent in the second half of the year.</span>
    We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these 
challenges.
    Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related startup costs have wound down as these factories have moved 
into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS.
    Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to Fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment 
charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $<span class="r3">106</span> million cost to the P&amp;L included within restructuring and 
other.
    We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.
    Elon Musk

Yes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our Bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain
as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate.
    So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China.
    We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is you made the right economic call before most on inflation when you diversified into Bitcoin.
    It has since shown it’s not much of a hedge in the real world test in the last few months.
    How do you think about it as an asset over long-term and what do you need to see to change your view?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Well, Tesla is – Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.</span>
    We are not really – cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow.
    So, it’s – we are not a – cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot.
    We think a lot about scaling production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat 
waves around earth, so to emphasize the urgency of that transition.
    So that is what we are trying to do is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage battery packs.
    But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future, which is like solar and wind for energy generation, stationary
battery packs for storage of the solar energy because of its intermittency and then electric vehicles, the third pillar.
    And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization.
    And the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we’re doing this, so certainly, my primary motivation here is to 
have the day of sustainable energy comes sooner.

<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">328</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    So the first order of business is really get the basics right, get to high volume and high reliability and then very
rapidly iterate within that to enhance the energy density and reduce the cost of the cell.
    Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
    It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited 
about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.</span>
    The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
    And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire 
supply chain.
    The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount 
battery output per year?
    This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the 
pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
    So yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
    I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.

<span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">346</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition 
to sustainability?
    The answer is no.
    Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could 
fully transition Earth to sustainable energy.
    The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production.
    How fast can that grow?
    It’s growing fast with the faster it grows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy.
    Pierre Ferragu

This is actually a great exactly where my follow-up is.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Elon, you always mention this </span><span class="r6">50</span><span class="r6">% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have.</span>
    And so my question here is when we see like the difficulty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging 
prices, I’m kind of wondering, as you are planning for this <span class="r3">50</span>% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next <span class="r3">5</span> to 
<span class="r3">10</span> years, how much of that do you feel you’ve secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts and things 
like that?
    And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business.
    So does that mean you don’t have enough lithium secured to grow <span class="r3">50</span>% per annum over multiple years?
    And what’s – how much of that is secured today?
    And how fast can you improve that basically?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think it’s very difficult to predict anything <span class="r3">10</span> years from now.
    I hope civilization is still around, frankly.

    Emmanuel, go ahead and un-mute yourself.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Yes.
    Thank you so much.
    I have a question on your vehicle demand and then a quick follow-up on supply.
    First, on the demand side.
    Are you seeing any sort of pressure in the order book or the pace of new order or any sort of like slowdown as a 
result of the pressures that the consumer is experiencing?
    Are you worried about it in light of your view of the risks to the economy that I think you expressed, Elon?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Well, right now, our firm is very much production.</span>
    So, we have long leads on – as anyone can tell, if they order our car, if you order Model Y, it will arrive sometime
next year.
    So, this is clearly not an issue for many months for us.
    Our problem is overwhelmingly that of production.
    So, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Okay.
    Maybe just two things to add.
    Specifically on your question, are we seeing a macroeconomic impact on our demand, not that I can tell.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">339</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the 
pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
    So yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
    I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
    And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as 
possible?
    And we’re taking these risks that we’ve discussed at Battery Day.
    And our plan is as we de-risk them and they are successful, we want to bring them back to our partners so that they 
can go faster, too, because that’s all on the mission, right, like how do we accelerate.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition </span>
<span class="r6">to sustainability?</span>
    The answer is no.
    Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could 
fully transition Earth to sustainable energy.
    The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production.

    So Elon, you always mention this <span class="r3">50</span>% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have.

<span class="r4">7</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">293</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
    Thanks for taking my question.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far?
    Sorry.
    And the reason why I’m asking – sorry.
    Andrew Baglino

Go ahead.
    Pierre Ferragu

And the reason why I’m asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who shared experience about 
trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviors and like recharging behavior that 
suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage, very high range, and were like artificially limited in
range in software.
    So I’m just kind of trying to understand how much of an edge you’re building at the moment with the <span class="r3">4680</span> and the 
battery back on range.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer, like as Elon mentioned before, our priority was </span>
<span class="r6">really on simplicity and scale during the initial </span><span class="r6">4680</span><span class="r6"> and structural battery ramp.</span>
    So we weren’t like putting all the bells and whistles in from day <span class="r3">1</span> because if so, we would be sort of suffering 
under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going.
    But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we’ve stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year, we are 
certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs, but like holding back 
goodies for some rainy day or something like that.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Maybe another way of putting it is that the – our focus right now is on the dozens of little issues that inhibit the
production ramp of the <span class="r3">4680</span>.
    Some of the more challenging ones have been feeding the anode-cathode material because we’re using this 
revolutionary dry electrode process.
    But when something is revolutionary, it’s a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved.
    So we’re confident of resolving those unknowns but it’s very difficult.

<span class="r4">9</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">112</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    This target has become more difficult, but it remains possible with strong execution and as Elon mentioned, no more 
force majeure events for the balance of the year.
    Elon Musk

Yes, a lot of force majeure in the last several years, that’s for sure.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to the questions from investors.
    And the first question is, Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job than their Western competitors, 
excluding Tesla, at innovating in software and design.
    How can Tesla make sure the company is staying ahead of those manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Well, the – right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla  (ph).</span>
    We are actually doing the best, thanks to our incredible team in China.
    But I have a lot of respect for the Chinese, our manufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular.
    I think they will be a force to be reckoned with worldwide.
    They are very – they are smart and they are hardworking.
    And I think anyone who is not – any company that’s not as competitive as them will obviously suffer a market share 
decline.
    So obviously, we have a lot of respect for the current companies in China and then their capabilities, yes.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">544</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And I would actually like to take a moment to thank our key suppliers once again for supporting us through difficult
times.
    And they really went above and beyond to support us.
    So, to all our suppliers out there, thanks very much.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    And I guess just maybe we don’t talk about it very often, but we do have a lot of custom silicon in the vehicle 
already.
    Microcontrollers, yes, some, battery management, yes, some, power electronics, yes, some.
    So, we try to go after where there is actually a technical advantage.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in the future, I think we are going to look at where there is a supplier…</span>

<span class="r6">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Even now where there are supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, get into it with us on the engineering side </span>
<span class="r6">when we find solutions, whether it’s alternative chips or changing the entire structure of this pack to make it work.</span>
    And I think that’s an advantage we have that many other OEs just simply cannot.
    I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company.
    And so one of the ways that we have been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is by rewriting 
software to be able to use different chips, or in some cases, achieve dual use of a single chip, which is even better.
    And actually, quite frankly, the chip shortage has served as a forcing function for us to reduce the number of chips
in the car.
    Yes, turns out we had more chips than we needed.
    But that’s a testament to our software team that we are able to roll a new chip into the car, write a whole new 
patch of software for that chip and – without interrupting production.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
