[TSLA_Q2_2023] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #86]  Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and **energy** **business**, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments.
2. [Sentence #90]  For our **energy** **business**, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with **Megapack**.
3. [Sentence #115]  Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas **scale** up to date.
4. [Sentence #117]  The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla **Energy** products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
5. [Sentence #120]  **Megapack** continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023.
6. [Sentence #137]  For **Powerwall** that’s eligible to provide the full stack of **energy** services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.
7. [Sentence #217]  **Elon** Musk

Well, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it.
8. [Sentence #222]  **Elon** Musk

Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive **business**, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology.
10. [Sentence #523]  **Elon** Musk

Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.
