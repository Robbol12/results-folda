this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
    This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as
new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our 
R&amp;D spend.
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, </span>
<span class="r5">particularly with Megapack.</span>
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
    However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.
    Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.
    Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.

    But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term.
    So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at.
    I mean, Zachary?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I fully agree with you.
    I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we 
generating enough money to continue to invest.
    And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense.
    It’s intense in terms of investment; it’s intense in terms of potential.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing </span>
<span class="r5">massive amounts of money in new technology.</span>
    That is super hard.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And vertical integration.
    It’s not even just like new products, but also<span class="r8">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes.
    We actually make our share<span class="r8">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest.
    That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction.
    Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest?
    Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we’ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and
with -- a set of that we’ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest
the cash.

    That’s completely amortized.
    So, we’ll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away.
    And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, 
improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do.
    So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement.
    Of course, the commodities spiked up and down.
    Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I’m totally agreeing.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And they’re recovering now.
    Karn Budhiraj

Cobalt -- the way it used to be.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And we’re still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost down curve of Austin and 
Berlin.
    And so, it takes time to work the cost out it.
    First, it’s a focus on ramp -- ramp, it brings cost down<span class="r8">...</span>

Elon Musk

And quality costs…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r3">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span class="r3">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r3">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span class="r3">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.

    We recently surpassed <span class="r3">0.5</span> million Powerwalls installed.
    Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their
vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof.
    Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support 
to ERCOT.
    We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over 
time as ERCOT expands market access.
    And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model <span class="r3">3</span> owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle 
customers over the rest of the quarter.
    Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers
requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
    In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access 
that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system </span>
<span class="r5">buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.</span>

    The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing 
incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

All right.
    I can take that.
    On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect 
these to be for the course of this year in the range of $<span class="r3">150</span> million to $<span class="r3">250</span> million per quarter.
    We are staying within that boundary as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well.
    I will note, and I think we’ve mentioned this before, that this includes a <span class="r3">50</span>-<span class="r3">50</span> sharing of credits for qualified 
cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic.

Yes.
    And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually do that all the time, so
-- because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway.
    So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings.
    But the cast --basically cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better noise vibration, harshness, much 
easier to manufacture.
    It’s better in every way.
