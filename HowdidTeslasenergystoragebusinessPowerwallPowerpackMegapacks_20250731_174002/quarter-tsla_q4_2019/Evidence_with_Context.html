    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r3">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass </span>
<span class="r5">Roof.</span>
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r3">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.

<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">261</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    I mean is that something that&#x27;s feasible for you guys to execute on a consistent basis a level of capacity building 
that large?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I mean, I think…

Elon Musk

We&#x27;re having for more than <span class="r3">30</span>%, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I think they&#x27;re not -- I&#x27;m not sure the math that you&#x27;ve done, but I think our internal plans are faster.
    And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the <span class="r3">10</span>-K, but back to the growth 
rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support 
that growth.
    So that helps.
    And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to 
continue to fund additional factory.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that </span>
<span class="r5">Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.
    Operator

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">166</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r3">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r3">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r3">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> </span>
<span class="r5">and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.</span>
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
    So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, 
a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
    Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And also on working capital.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.

    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening, everybody.
    So in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in <span class="r3">2020</span>.
    Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve, obviously you 
have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price.
    So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like steadily in <span class="r3">2020</span>?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Making the price better and better, so is the value.</span>
    I know we&#x27;re wondering we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand looks like, I 
mean like right now it&#x27;s pretty good, maybe they will change who knows, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

But I think the way you described, it is fair.
    So I mean, relative to the current Model <span class="r3">3</span>, China Model <span class="r3">2</span> pricing is slightly lower.
    And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
    So you can see that it&#x27;s clearly slightly higher than what Model <span class="r3">3</span> is out of Fremont.
    How the mix of those three products and that&#x27;s out over the course of the year, we&#x27;ll see.
    I think it&#x27;s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP, when you 
average them together.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">418</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    And so there was a slight drag associated with it, but not terribly significant.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And let&#x27;s go to the last question, please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our last question will come from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities.
    Joseph Osha

Further to the conversation around the cell technology, just wondering if you can comment on what the plans are for the 
Maxwell technology that you acquired here as a capacitor or dry cell or what have you?
    Thanks.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, like I said, we&#x27;re going to talk about this in Battery Day, which is probably April.</span>
    And then a lot of these questions will be answered.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be a very compelling story that we have to present.
    I think it&#x27;s going to actually block those minds, of course my mind and I know it.
    So it&#x27;s going to be pretty cool.
    Joseph Osha

Maxwell that ultracap technology is kind of part of -- part of the plan?
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s an important piece of the puzzle, yes.
    I think like some of the sort of retail investors have managed to put together several piece of the puzzle that it 
had the most insight.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">216</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, actually the core chemistry inside the <span class="r3">18650</span> cell has improved many times over the years.
    So, it&#x27;s really the form factor as opposed to a core technology.
    So it&#x27;s, yes, I think we&#x27;re pretty happy with where the -- the energy content, the sell-in, the improvements in 
efficiency of both vehicle.
    We&#x27;re rapidly approaching a <span class="r3">400</span> mile range for the Model S, for example.
    So this is -- it won&#x27;t be long before Model S is <span class="r3">400</span> mile range.
    Anything you want to add to that?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Unidentified Company Representative</span>

<span class="r5">No other than to say that the </span><span class="r5">18650</span><span class="r5"> line is running smoothly for really long time and in a world where self-supply is </span>
<span class="r5">fueling growth like or part of the fuel growth, I don&#x27;t see a reason to turn that self-supply off, so…</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, and actually the Model S and X actually have more range than we are currently stating on the website.</span>
    We just haven&#x27;t gotten around to updating the I guess the EPA sort of right number, but the actual range of the 
Model S and X are above what the websites as there are, yes the existing cars are better, so that being made.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Actually been that way for<span class="r8">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes, it must be somewhere in the 380s of what like that.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much and Sherry let&#x27;s go to the Q&amp;A on the phone.
    Operator

Thank you, again.
    <span class="r2">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r2">]</span> Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    Adam Jonas

Hi, everybody and actually agree the retail questions were excellent actually.
    So Elon, do you see potential for Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the 
StarLink constellation in the near or medium-term future?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">7</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">332</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    But as we -- as we fix that then we will see a much higher people, percentage of people buying.
    And as we&#x27;re close to full self-driving that is just going to become more and more compelling.
    So that&#x27;s for our financial standpoint, that&#x27;s the real mind-blowing situation is high volume, high-margin because 
of autonomy.
    Colin Rusch

Okay.
    And then just shorter-term, there&#x27;s significant discussion in industry around moving to higher voltage on the 
Powertrain.
    And then some challenges around the supply chain preparedness to support that, separate from the battery packs since
we&#x27;ll talk about that in a couple of months.
    Can you speak to the areas of focus on Powertrain technology driven cost reduction over the next <span class="r3">12</span> to <span class="r3">24</span> months 
that we should be thinking about?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Well, Powertrain is pretty damn Good, I mean it&#x27;s very than anything else other by a country mile.</span>
    It&#x27;s worth noting for example at the -- the Model S has like <span class="r3">100</span> kilowatt pack, but Tacon  has <span class="r3">100</span> kilowatt like <span class="r3">95</span> 
kilowatt hour pack.
    The Model S is steadily approaching <span class="r3">400</span> miles range, the Tacon has <span class="r3">200</span> miles range.
    So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently and the Powertrain is a big part of that.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I would just say that focus is on cost on the Powertrain when we&#x27;re thinking about technology innovations, it&#x27;s how do 
we continue to drive the cost down.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And that&#x27;s through voltages maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and 
lower cost.
    Elon Musk

Looks like Powertrain is like mind blowing I think.

    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much guys.
    Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reduction, as well as the mission to increase EV 
adoption.
    Is there a target for gross profit or operating profit on a per-vehicle basis that we should be thinking about or 
how should we really frame that for ourselves?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yes, I mean we&#x27;re trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable </span>
<span class="r5">-- while still being at least a little bit profitable and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash flow </span>
<span class="r5">and accumulating our cash balance.</span>
    Zach, anything you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No, I think that&#x27;s fair say.
    I mean our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now.
    We&#x27;re working very hard to reduce cost and expand production because I mean we feel from the data it&#x27;s pretty clear 
that there&#x27;s a lot of interest in our products.
    And so -- we&#x27;re working on is to increase production, increase availability of the products with time.
    And the price reduction in China, kind of, the first step towards this global localization, more accessible price 
and we&#x27;ll continue to work on cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean the thing that&#x27;s really going to I think probably just have a profound effect on our financials is like is 
high volume and high margin obviously and that high-margin part comes from autonomy.

    Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla  network app before full autonomy and change
the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
    If so when will this happen?
    Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.

<span class="r5">Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?</span>
    Martin Viecha

Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a bundle, yes.
    Elon Musk

Well, I think it&#x27;s – it probably will make sense to have like to enable car sharing in advance of the kind of sort of 
drive robo-taxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before full self-driving is approved by regulators.
    So, it&#x27;s probably something that we would enable before sort of robo-taxi fleet is enabled.
    And, it sounded like there were some other questions bundled in there?
    Martin Viecha

Superchargers at airports.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Yes, probably we&#x27;ll have superchargers in the airports.
