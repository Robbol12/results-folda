    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> How did Tesla’s energy storage business <span class="r2">(</span>Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack<span class="r2">)</span> scale from <span class="r3">2019</span> to <span class="r3">2024</span>, and was
this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

<span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">30</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.
    It&#x27;s really a gem.
    So I&#x27;m super proud of the people that work there.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted.
    The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over <span class="r3">1.2</span> million units delivered.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The energy storage business delivered nearly </span><span class="r5">15</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours of batteries in </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5">, compared to </span><span class="r5">6.5</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours </span>
<span class="r5">the year before.</span>
    So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
    And yeah, I think we&#x27;ll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span class="r3">4.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The key among them being total cost of ownership.
    This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.
    We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support 
the overall demand.
    There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market.
    First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y,
which means an immediate reduction of $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">500</span> at the time of purchase to the end customer.
    Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model <span class="r3">3</span> and Y using our Partner Leasing Program.
    Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by </span>
<span class="r5">more than </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">%.</span>
    This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in <span class="r3">2024</span>.
    This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our 
Megafactory in Lathrop.
    I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.
    Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our 
fleet grows.
    As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
    For <span class="r3">2024</span>, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing 
investments in our future growth initiatives.
    Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for <span class="r3">2024</span> to be in excess of $<span class="r3">10</span> billion.

    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full </span>
<span class="r5">self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.</span>
    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span class="r3">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
    That&#x27;s over <span class="r3">400</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> vehicles in North America.
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle 
controls.
    We replaced <span class="r3">330</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> lines of C++ code with neural nets.

    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you.
    The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
    And just a brief update from the business perspective.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through </span><span class="r5">&#x27;24 and &#x27;25</span><span class="r5">.</span>
    We want to thank all of our partners who&#x27;ve put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical 
infrastructure around the world.
    And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong <span class="r3">2023</span> execution.
    Lathrop continues to ramp through <span class="r3">2024</span> with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from <span class="r3">20</span>
gigawatt to <span class="r3">40</span> gigawatt hours by the end of the year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is from Siddharth, what are the preliminary results and return on investment of your 
ads and education campaign?
    Given that many people still lack awareness that Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price 
of $<span class="r3">45</span>,<span class="r3">000</span>, will you expand educational ads?
    Unidentified Company Representative

As Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really address the affordability issue.

    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
    It&#x27;s definitely the smart move.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from Siddharth.
    What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting 
there?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Optimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the </span>
<span class="r5">potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined.</span>
    When you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita.
    But what if there&#x27;s no limit to capita?
    There&#x27;s no limit to the economy.
    And the technologies that we&#x27;ve -- AI technologies that we&#x27;ve developed for the car translate quite well to a 
humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on four wheels.
    Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world.
    It&#x27;s just a four-wheeled robot.
    So Optimus is a humanoid robot with arms and legs.

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.
    That&#x27;s our best product ever.

previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.

    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And our CFO, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
    Good afternoon, everyone.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as </span>
<span class="r5">record deployments in our energy business.</span>
    This was achieved despite <span class="r3">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span class="r3">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span class="r3">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span class="r3">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span class="r3">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.
    Our <span class="r3">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span class="r3">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span class="r3">500</span>.

    The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Like, I said in my opening remarks, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles.
    This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the 
packaging used to get the materials to the production flow.
    Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further.
    A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which 
I mentioned leads to cost reduction.
    This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible.
    We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of...</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">We don&#x27;t know.</span>
    We don&#x27;t have a crystal ball, so it&#x27;s difficult for us to predict this with precision.
    If the interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good.
    And if they don&#x27;t come down quickly, they won&#x27;t be that good.
    Yeah.
    It&#x27;s always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.
    It&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t want.
    We have tons of -- we have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it.
