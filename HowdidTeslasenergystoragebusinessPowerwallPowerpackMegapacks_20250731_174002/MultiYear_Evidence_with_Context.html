Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.</span>
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r3">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r3">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">83</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r3">3</span> in <span class="r3">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r3">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.</span>
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So we run any car changes through battery tests and simulation.
    Then we have a global QA team, which I&#x27;m on, actually.
    I&#x27;m one of -- on the global QA team.
    And we test the releases in the real world, the essence of real-world in a simulation, which is -- which are very 
many, because the world is very complex and where -- and then we release it to a small group of private beta testers 
within the company; then to a larger audience, including people outside the company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; 
and then finally, a broad release.
    And so there are many stages that these things go through.
    So, by the time something is being -- going to wide release into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages.
    And the software that&#x27;s at the very early stage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, just going to go through a very rigorous safety process.</span>
    So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in 
intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that 
kind of thing, when those eventually come back.
    Those are extra hard cases.
    But it&#x27;s all tracking very well.
    If you like, the water pallets engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I&#x27;m deeply 
involved with the team.
    So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
    So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we&#x27;re headed.
    And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we&#x27;ll have the functionality that’s really cool, also 
driving by the end of the year.

    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.</span>
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">55</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r3">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r3">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.</span>
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r3">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">7</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">330</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the 
vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the <span class="r3">3</span> and all of the Y.
    So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes 
against all their constitutional rights, that in my opinion, and breaking people&#x27;s freedoms in ways that are horrible 
and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the fuck?
    Excuse me.
    But outrage -- it’s an outrage.
    So -- but it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies.
    And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not.
    And all peoples -- everything people have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real 
time.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re going to have many suppliers -- or have many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the </span>
<span class="r5">small ones, and it&#x27;s causing a lot of strife to a lot of people.</span>
    Yes.
    Adam Jonas

Elon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country.
    My fault for you on this.
    There have been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the U.S. economy in the early 1930s when Roosevelt began 
a series of new deals and infrastructure projects or post-World War <span class="r3">2</span> when Eisenhower launched the U.S. Highway Act and 
JFK launched the Apollo Program, which you could say was influenced by the Cold War, clearly, and you benefited from and
our space program benefited from.
    What would be your message to U.S. lawmakers on this call as we – in addition to your opinion on shelter in place, 
but thinking the longer term, your message to U.S. lawmakers coming out of the crisis, specifically around EV 
infrastructure and a chance to work with taxpayers to support sustainable transport and renewable energy?
    I&#x27;m wondering if you see this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain.
    Thanks.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are collecting data from over </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> million intersections every month at this point.</span>
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r3">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
    It’s the reason I say it&#x27;s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is 
training Google all the time with their searches.

Thanks.
    And I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well.
    I think like – I can&#x27;t remember – I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you&#x27;ve always mentioned 
that demand for energy storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you can make.
    And so I&#x27;m kind of thinking there will be – there should be an inflection point in that business at some point, and 
it&#x27;s going to be driven by your ability to add much more manufacturing capacity like battery manufacturing capacity.
    And at a high level, how are you thinking about that inflection point in terms of time line?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

In terms of time line, I think what we&#x27;ve been doing with both our partners and internally is looking at how to reduce 
the – fundamentally the cost of investments in new sales capacity because when you look at a car – a vehicle product, 
there&#x27;s a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells.
    When you look at an energy storage product, it&#x27;s really just the cells.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so to really grow the energy storage business, it&#x27;s all about cell investments.</span>
    And so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been focused on.
    And I think not to give too much away, but that will be one of the things we address in Battery Investor Day is how 
we&#x27;re focused on that.
    And when we have that in the place we want, it will be a lot easier to scale that business.
    Martin Viecha

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla First Quarter <span class="r3">2021</span> Results and 
Q&amp;A Webcast.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both 
from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
    So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the
next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard
to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.</span>
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.

    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all </span>
<span class="r5">our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.</span>
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.

<span class="r5">Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.</span>
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.

profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r3">14</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai is the dramatically </span>
<span class="r5">improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r3">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.

    After the Model <span class="r3">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we</span>
<span class="r5">feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.</span>
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r3">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r3">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.

    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r3">3</span> in <span class="r3">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r3">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.</span>
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.

    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r3">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.

Thank you.
    And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and
most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
    It&#x27;s not out of the question, but our brand is full.
    Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
    That&#x27;s not out of the question.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.</span>
    And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you&#x27;ve got to store the power, stationary 
storage.
    And then you&#x27;ve got to have electric transportation.
    So -- and we don&#x27;t have, like, say, specific market share goals or anything like that.
    It&#x27;s just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that&#x27;s a fundamental good 
for the world, and we want to do that as fast as possible.
    But it&#x27;s not, like you said, market share growth is a goal in and of itself.
    It&#x27;s just the faster this happens, the better the world will do.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">19</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">138</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r3">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.

    I would love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that&#x27;s going to look 
prior to the robo taxi stage?
    Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time?
    Or how do you see that playing out?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is, we&#x27;ll release more and more functionality.
    Yes, before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing.
    First, we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.
    So we run any car changes through battery tests and simulation.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then we have a global QA team, which I&#x27;m on, actually.</span>
    I&#x27;m one of -- on the global QA team.
    And we test the releases in the real world, the essence of real-world in a simulation, which is -- which are very 
many, because the world is very complex and where -- and then we release it to a small group of private beta testers 
within the company; then to a larger audience, including people outside the company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; 
and then finally, a broad release.
    And so there are many stages that these things go through.
    So, by the time something is being -- going to wide release into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages.
    And the software that&#x27;s at the very early stage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.
    So, just going to go through a very rigorous safety process.
    So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in 
intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that 
kind of thing, when those eventually come back.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
    So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new 
Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.</span>
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span class="r3">2020</span>.

    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span class="r3">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span class="r3">16</span> or <span class="r3">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It’s not like model <span class="r3">3</span> and Y – Model <span class="r3">3</span> and Y also – they&#x27;re way better than any other cars to the best of my 
knowledge.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal </span>
<span class="r5">car.</span>
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span class="r3">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.

    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
    When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, 
then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or 
something on Amazon and -- except it&#x27;s a car.
    Yes.
    All right.
    And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in <span class="r3">90</span> seconds, so.

Okay.
    And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progress stores development and 
commercialization of Full Self-Driving?
    How much revenue have you recognized so far?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So there is a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving.
    And so, currently, in North America, it&#x27;s sold for $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> as an option.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue.</span>
    That&#x27;s associated with features that will be released with time.
    Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
    It&#x27;s a little bit over $<span class="r3">600</span> million.
    And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been 
released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
    And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
    So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is our second large-scale product launch since Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in </span><span class="r5">2017</span><span class="r5"> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on </span>
<span class="r5">cost control and ramp efficiency.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r3">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.

<span class="r4">30</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">90</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts </span>
<span class="r5">receivable on the balance sheet.</span>
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
