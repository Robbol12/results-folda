     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
>>> Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
     We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

     Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
     We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
     Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
     We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
     On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
     We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products.
     Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.
>>> We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.
     And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
     Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
     On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing, and other activities.
     We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
     The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
     We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.

     And especially super thankful to the people in this room and dozens of people outside of this room that I've worked for over the years.
     I think the team's strength and teamwork at Tesla is unlike anything else I've seen in my career.
     Elon, thank you very much for this opportunity that I got back in 2017.
     Thank you for seeking investor feedback and regularly and debating it with me.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Well, I mean the reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I had seen.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> Elon Musk

So, thank you for helping Tesla to get to where it is today over seven years.
     It's been a pleasure working with you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you so much.
     And yes, thank you for all the thousands of shareholders that we've met over the years and walked around factories and loved all the interactions, even the tough ones.
     And yes, looking forward to the call in the next three months, but I'll be on the other side, listening in.
     Thank you very much.

     Adam, please go ahead and unmute.
     Adam Jonas

Okay.
     Great.
     Hey, Elon.
     So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate, notably lower than that achieved in 2023.
     But what's your team's degree of confidence on growth above 0%?
     Or in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year-on-year?
>>> Elon Musk

No, I think we'll have higher sales this year than last year.
     Adam Jonas

Okay.
     My follow-up, Elon, on future product.
     If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next-gen cheaper vehicles, more aggressive giga castings, I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unboxed, 300-mile range, $25,000 price point, putting aside robotaxi, those features unique to you.
     How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years from now?
     How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

I mean, I don't know what our competitors could do, except we've done relatively better than they have.

     I mean that distributed power and cooling, people underestimate that costs a lot of money.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     And the CapEx is shared by the entire world sort of everyone wants a small chunk, and they get a small profit out of it, maybe.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much guys.
     And just my follow-up is a little bit more mundane.
     Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you were to target yields and when you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?
>>> Elon Musk

We're making good progress on that, but I don't think it's super important for at least in the near term.
     As Lars said, we think it will be, exceed the competitiveness of suppliers by the end of this year and then we'll continue to improve.
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     I mean, I think it's important to note also that like the ramp right now is relevant to the Cybertruck ramp.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

And so like we're not going to just randomly build 4680s unless we have a place to put them and so we're going to make sure we're prudent about that, but we also have a lot of investments with all our cell suppliers and vendors.
     They're great partners, and they've done great development work with us and a lot of the advancements in technologies and chemistry we found 4680, they're also putting into their cells.
     Elon Musk

Yes.

     There's some duplication of efforts, which happens in certain areas.
     So you need to go back and look at where all these pockets are, get rid of it.
     So we're basically going through that exercise wherein we're like, hey, how do we set this company right for the next phase of growth.
     And the way to think about it is any tree which grows, it needs pruning.
     This is the pruning exercise which we went through.
     And at the end of it, we'll be much stronger and much more resilient to deal with the future because the future is really bright.
     Like I said in my opening remarks, we just have to get through this period and get there.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, we're not giving up anything that is significant that I'm aware of.
     So we've had a long period of prosperity from 2019 to now.
     And so if a company sort of organizationally is 5% wrong per year, that accumulates to 25%, 30% of inefficiency.
     We've made some corrections along the way.
     But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth and you really need to reorganize it, just like a human when we start off with one cell and kind of zygote, blastocyst and you start growing arms and legs and briefly, you have a tail.
     And so…

Alex Potter

But you shed the tail.
     Elon Musk

You shed the tail, hopefully.
     And then you're baby, you basically, you have to be the organism – a company is kind of like creature growing.

     But from vast majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck.
     So it actually makes a difference if the cost per month for lease refinancing is $10 one way or the other.
     So it is important to keep improving the affordability and to keep making the price.
     Lars Moravy

More accessible.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
     Lars Moravy

But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price.
     And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing.
     So there’s like – you can’t just be static.
     You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what we’re doing.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model 3 is a fantastic car.
     I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different.
     I mean it looks and feels different.
