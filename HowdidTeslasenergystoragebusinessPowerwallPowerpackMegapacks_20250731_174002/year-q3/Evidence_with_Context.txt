[Year Q3] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #2259, TSLA_Q3_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, to recap, as someone was saying, something that what -- the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3.
     Tesla, at the same time, has achieved record deliveries.
     In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable.
     And I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company that is profitable.
     So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us.
     So, we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla.
     That's staggering the immense amount of work to make 7 million cars.
>>> So, you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.
     And as you all know, on October 10, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot.
     And we had 50 autonomous vehicles.
     There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Ys, operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of people with no incidents the entire night.
     And all those who went there that worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels, meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to and the whole night went very smoothly.
     So, regarding the vehicle business, we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting in the first half of 2025.
     This is -- I think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year.
     And at the risk of -- to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year, notwithstanding negative external events, like if there's some force majeure events, like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that.
-----
2. [Sentence #116, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business.
     On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin.
     Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
     We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
     We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.
     We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
>>> In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
-----
3. [Sentence #1813, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PILOT]
     Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500.
     We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
     Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
     On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
     We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.
     However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
     This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion.
>>> Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
     Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.
     As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
     And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
     We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
     However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
     To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month.
     In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the 1% point come in.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
     So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
     But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
     And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power.
     So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time.
>>> So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.
     Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
     So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
     And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And we try to model out like, let’s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year.
     Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
-----
5. [Sentence #1292, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
>>> On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
     Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
     Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
     This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe.
     Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
     Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks.
     As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics.
     We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
-----
6. [Sentence #675, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.
     I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
     These teams' expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these challenges.
     Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.
     The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
>>> Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
     Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
     And we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
     Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29%, excluding regulatory credits, which was our strongest yet.
     This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
     The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.
     As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
     However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
-----
7. [Sentence #138, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
     So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
     I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
     RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
     First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
     Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar.
>>> Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
     We have more demand than supply through 2021 and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond.
     Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
     Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe.
     This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
     This is true for standalone storage as well.
     Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.
     For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.

8. [Sentence #137, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.

9. [Sentence #158, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PILOT]
     As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.
     We're using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company.
     Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
     We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
     We're pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation.
     Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
     Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
>>> In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
     I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
     And let's begin with questions from say.com.
     The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production?
     Can Tesla share more information on what products you'll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Drew, do you want to take that?
-----
10. [Sentence #302, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We're ramping up stationary storage a lot.
     So I mean, it's approximately doubling as we expect, it's approximately double next year.
     So that's pretty good.
     And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.
     Drew Baglino

And approximately doubling it this year, too.
>>> So the growth...

Elon Musk

Yes, yes, yes.
     I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells.
     Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard.
     Delays happen.
     What contingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and Texas?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So I think it's -- we're trying to derisk to 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on our internal cell production.
     It's very, very small.
-----
11. [Sentence #1421, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.
     And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
     Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
     Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
     Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
     And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
-----
12. [Sentence #2031, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
     So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
     It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.
     And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right?
     And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.
     In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other established factory, which is Fremont.
     So that was a positive in the quarter.
>>> When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there.
     And that product has done well.
     I mean, on the cost curve also, we’ve been able to do a lot there.
     But I do want to caution that Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy.
     So yes, we had a great quarter this period.
     But depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods where there would be downward pressure on deployment because of us trying to get the product to that base way…

Unidentified Company Representative

Yes, product in transit.
     Yes.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
-----
13. [Sentence #608, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think you're probably right about that.
     I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid operator.
     So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe.
     And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
>>> So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those 2 working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.
     RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
     So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we're continuing to make money off of that power plant.
     Philippe Houchois

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration approach.
     It's very interesting.
     And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?
-----
14. [Sentence #1284, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     You’re the ones making it happen.
     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
>>> Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.

15. [Sentence #1772, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
>>> Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
-----
16. [Sentence #2368, TSLA_Q3_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And then with Optimus, we showed a massive improvement in Optimus dexterity improvement on October 10.
     And our next-gen hand and forearm, which is 22 degrees of freedom, which is double the prior hand or forearm, it's extremely human-like, and so it's much better at tactile sensing.
     It's really -- I feel confident in saying that we have the most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot.
     And we're moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots.
     Because the things that -- what other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI brain, that they're missing people to really scale to very high-volume production.
     So, you see some impressive video demos, but what like the localized AI and the volume to very high numbers.
     As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be the most valuable part, so I think has a good chance of being the most viable product that we made.
>>> For the energy business, that's doing extremely well.
     And the opportunity ahead is gigantic.
     The Lathrop Megapack factory reached 200 Megapacks a week, which is now a 40-gigawatt hour a year run rate.
     And we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with the 20-gigawatt hour a year run rate in Q1 next year so next quarter.
     And that will also scale out.
     It won't be long before we're shipping 100-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at Tesla.
     And will that -- I mean, that will ultimately grow, I think, to multiple terawatt hours per year.
     It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future.

     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
     At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
     So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the cars.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
     I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
     And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
     There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.
     Just try one.
     Epic.

     I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
     Our Q3 results were announced at about 1 PM Pacific time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

19. [Sentence #1773, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
>>> And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.

20. [Sentence #1333, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

21. [Sentence #1386, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
     And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.
     It’s excellent.
     But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
     And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.

22. [Sentence #152, TSLA_Q3_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.
     We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders.
     We're just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are providing services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.
     This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
     In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after tax incentives, which is the lowest in the industry.
     We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales and marketing.
     As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.
>>> We're using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company.
     Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
     We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
     We're pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation.
     Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
     Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
     In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
     I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

     Where is it going to be made?
     How is it going to be shipped?
     How is it going to be assembled into the vehicle?
     At any one point if something is done in the silo, it becomes a bottleneck of either cost or time or efficiency, but with the robotaxi development, like we've done a good job on the combining all that and then like blowing up how it's made and saying it should be made this way and rethinking it also that it's the most efficient factory possible.
     That shows our -- it will see our capex efficiency when we deploy it shows in the number of parts, simplicity of vehicle but also help performance in terms of like end user state.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.
     Just to close out, just on the emerging front also in '25, we will have started manufacturing of car.
>>> We'll continue to increase our storage deployments with Powerwall 3.
     We plan to continue expanding our supercharging network, getting more OEMs on our network, 4680 that as Elon talked about, that would keep going.
     And then also we'll have our lithium refinery starting to produce.
     So, there's a lot which is going on.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, so many things.
     Like crazy thing is like Tesla is winning basically on almost every single thing we're doing.
     If we're not running now, we're in a where their entire large companies, that's the only thing they do.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

     Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
     We have more demand than supply through 2021 and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond.
     Our order book is rapidly filling up through 2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
     Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations across the globe.
     This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
     This is true for standalone storage as well.
     Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.

     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
     So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
>>> I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
     RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
     First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
     Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar.
     Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
     We have more demand than supply through 2021 and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand across the globe through 2023 and beyond.

     I'm Carl, I'm on the Solar Roof engineering and installation.
     The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced.
     We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire.
     The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site.
     We've talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips.
     Also, we've had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they're ramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you, Carl.
>>> Elon Musk

I mean, here's the way to think about that product, in my opinion.
     You have to say, I think what do you want the world to look like?
     When you look around the neighborhood future, decade from now, what do you want?
     What products are going to make your life better?
     What future do you want?
     And I think a future where we've got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy.
     That's the future we want.
     The Solar Roof is a killer product.

27. [Sentence #2453, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PLAN]
     The Tesla team is hyper-focused on delivering on that version.
     All efforts are underway to make it a reality.
     While we've achieved significant progress this year, it will take time to get this as we find new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape.
     The future is incredibly bright, and I want to thank the Tesla team once again for all their help.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
     Now, we'll go to investor questions.
>>> The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year, as mentioned by Elon earlier?
     And how does it align with your AI and product road map?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
     I mean, as Elon and Vaibhav both said, we are on plan to meet that in the first half of next year.
     Ambition has always been to lower the cost of our vehicles to increase the adoption of sustainable energy and transport.
     Part of that is lowering the cost of our current vehicles, which is where all of the personally owned vehicles that we sell today come in.
     But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that's really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI road map.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.

28. [Sentence #1880, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     I don’t think it’s nothing.
     But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
     So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
     So, this is big deal.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.?
     I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
     So let’s go to the next one.
>>> Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.
     Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024?
     And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
     Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.
     I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
     So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe.

29. [Sentence #1802, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PILOT]
     The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.
     I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
     And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
     Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
     And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
>>> Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business.
     Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
     As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades.
     This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
     Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500.
     We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
     Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
     On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.

30. [Sentence #2068, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
     Elon Musk

Not at this time.
     Rod Lache

Okay.
     And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a vacuum.
     And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products.
     Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment?
     And any thoughts along those lines?
>>> Elon Musk

I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.
     I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they’re very unlikely to.
     It’s worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, they’re actually very difficult for the average person to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500, burning a hole in their bank account.
     A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt.
     They’ve got credit card debt, mortgage debt.
     So, that’s reality for most people.
     It’s sometimes difficult for people who are high income and I’d say high to be like someone who’s earning over $200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.
     So like for a lot of people, like this tax credit just -- they can’t front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6 months to get -- for the tax credit, and they actually don’t, in some case, even have that $7,500 in taxes.
