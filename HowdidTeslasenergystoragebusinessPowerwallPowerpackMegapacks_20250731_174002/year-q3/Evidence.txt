Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast.
2. [Sentence #116]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) In the **Energy** **business**, we achieved record **storage** deployments, aided by the positive reception of the **Megapack** and **Powerwall** products as production and deployments grow.
3. [Sentence #134]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our **Energy** **business** for a few comments.
4. [Sentence #137]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Q3 was a strong quarter for the **Energy** **business**, and we're poised for continued strong **growth** in **Energy** **storage** and solar.
5. [Sentence #138]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) **Megapack** is going to be a large **growth** segment for the **business** and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
6. [Sentence #145]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) For **PowerWall**, we see continued strong demand for residential **storage** as customers seek increased reliability and backup home generation.
7. [Sentence #152]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) We're using the same methodology across the entire **Energy** **business**, including service, to capitalize on the technology backbone of the company.
8. [Sentence #158]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) In closing, we believe the **Energy** segment is poised for a strong **growth** as we continue to focus on increasing **scale** while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
9. [Sentence #195]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) **Elon** Musk

I mean, here's the way to think about that product, in my opinion.
10. [Sentence #302]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) So the **growth**...

**Elon** Musk

Yes, yes, yes.
11. [Sentence #608]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) So **Megapack** on one end and then **PowerWall** on the other side, those 2 working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.
12. [Sentence #675]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Similar dynamics are also playing out in our **storage** **business** as we are working to expand **Powerwall** and **Megapack** production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
13. [Sentence #1284]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Just to continue on **Elon**’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and **storage** deployments in the third quarter.
14. [Sentence #1292]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On **energy** profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this **business**, driven primarily by record volumes of our **Megapack** and **Powerwall** products.
15. [Sentence #1333]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual **growth** rate.
16. [Sentence #1347]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) **Elon** Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
17. [Sentence #1386]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) **Elon** Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
18. [Sentence #1421]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) **Elon** Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable **energy**, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
19. [Sentence #1442]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) So that also -- we actually see the ****energy** **storage** **business****, stationary **storage**, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
20. [Sentence #1772]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Regarding **energy** **storage**, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of **energy** of **storage** products in Q3.
21. [Sentence #1773]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And as this **business** grows, the **energy** division is becoming our highest margin **business**.
22. [Sentence #1802]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our **energy** **business**.
23. [Sentence #1813]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with **energy** **business** leading the charge, primarily from the **growth** in **Megapack** deployments.
24. [Sentence #1880]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% **growth** versus 2023 guidance.
25. [Sentence #2031]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) When it comes to **energy** margins, **Megapack** deployment was the key driver there.
26. [Sentence #2068]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) **Elon** Musk

I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.
27. [Sentence #2259]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, you see, we all have -- the ****energy** **storage** **business**** is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both **Megapack** and **Powerwall**.
28. [Sentence #2368]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) For the **energy** **business**, that's doing extremely well.
29. [Sentence #2453]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year, as mentioned by **Elon** earlier?
30. [Sentence #2688]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) We'll continue to increase our **storage** deployments with **Powerwall** 3.
