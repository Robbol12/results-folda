growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

<span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2259</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2024]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, to recap, as someone was saying, something that what -- the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order
volumes in Q3.
    Tesla, at the same time, has achieved record deliveries.
    In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even 
profitable.
    And I&#x27;m not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company 
that is profitable.
    So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter 
actually is a record Q3 for us.
    So, we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it 
happen in Tesla.
    That&#x27;s staggering the immense amount of work to make <span class="r3">7</span> million cars.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both </span>
<span class="r6">Megapack and Powerwall.</span>
    And as you all know, on October <span class="r3">10</span>, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very 
compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the 
future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything 
but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot.
    And we had <span class="r3">50</span> autonomous vehicles.
    There were <span class="r3">20</span> Cybercabs, but there were an additional <span class="r3">30</span> Model Ys, operating fully autonomously the entire night, 
carrying thousands of people with no incidents the entire night.
    And all those who went there that worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator 
panels, meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to and the whole night went very
smoothly.
    So, regarding the vehicle business, we are still on track to deliver our affordable models starting in the first 
half of <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    This is -- I think probably people want should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year.
    And at the risk of -- to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which I think it&#x27;s <span class="r3">20</span>% to 
<span class="r3">30</span>% vehicle growth next year, notwithstanding negative external events, like if there&#x27;s some force majeure events, like 
some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I think it&#x27;s reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core
business.
    On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from <span class="r3">18.7</span>% to <span class="r3">23.7</span>%, with some of 
our programs achieving greater than <span class="r3">25</span>% gross margin.
    Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r3">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r3">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.
    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and </span>
<span class="r6">Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.</span>
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r3">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r3">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r3">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r3">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r3">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
    As were previous investments in Model <span class="r3">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span class="r3">2021</span> and <span class="r3">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r3">2</span> billion to $<span class="r3">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span class="r3">37</span>,<span class="r3">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
    However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
    This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately <span class="r2">[</span>$<span class="r3">8.9</span> billion<span class="r2">]</span> <span class="r2">(</span>ph<span class="r2">)</span> and free cash flows of
approximately $<span class="r3">2.3</span> billion.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, </span>
<span class="r6">primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.</span>
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span class="r3">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the <span class="r3">1</span>% point come in.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to 
actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
    So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
    But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- 
people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
    And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to 
buffer the power.
    So, you have <span class="r3">24</span>/<span class="r3">7</span> power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like </span><span class="r6">150</span><span class="r6">% to </span><span class="r6">200</span><span class="r6">% a </span>
<span class="r6">year, faster than cars by a lot.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.
    Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where 
our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our 
capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
    So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
    And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has 
mentioned.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we try to model out like, let’s say, <span class="r3">2023</span> is a brutal recession year.
    Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">1292</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span class="r3">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span class="r3">27.9</span>%.
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span class="r3">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record </span>
<span class="r6">volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.</span>
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
    Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on
outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate.
    This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the 
U.S. and Europe.
    Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound 
logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter.
    Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the 
final two weeks.
    As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound 
logistics.
    We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">675</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2021]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.
    I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive 
flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
    These teams&#x27; expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these 
challenges.
    Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we&#x27;re adding capacity as quickly as 
possible.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.
    The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our 
existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack </span>
<span class="r6">production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.</span>
    Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
    And we&#x27;re excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
    Financially, our auto gross margins reached <span class="r3">30.5</span>% on a GAAP basis and just under <span class="r3">29</span>%, excluding regulatory credits, 
which was our strongest yet.
    This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the 
Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
    The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the 
ramp of Model X.
    As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
    However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r3">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r3">500</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
    While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it&#x27;s possible with tight execution across the company.
    So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
    I&#x27;ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few 
comments.
    RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
    First, I&#x27;d like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
    Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we&#x27;re poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and 
solar.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as </span>
<span class="r6">the product reaches full capacity.</span>
    We have more demand than supply through <span class="r3">2021</span> and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand 
across the globe through <span class="r3">2023</span> and beyond.
    Our order book is rapidly filling up through <span class="r3">2023</span> in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
    Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations 
across the globe.
    This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
    This is true for standalone storage as well.
    Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced 
real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.
    For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and 
backup home generation.

    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r3">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r3">500</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions

    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
    Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation 
process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale </span>
<span class="r6">while reducing cost to maximize profitability.</span>
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
    The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start <span class="r3">4680</span> cell production at Giga Berlin at 
the same time as vehicle production?
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">302</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect to have enough internal or external battery 
capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deployments again?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We&#x27;re ramping up stationary storage a lot.
    So I mean, it&#x27;s approximately doubling as we expect, it&#x27;s approximately double next year.
    So that&#x27;s pretty good.
    And hopefully, we can accelerate that in years to come.
    Drew Baglino

And approximately doubling it this year, too.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the growth...</span>

<span class="r6">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yes, yes, yes.</span>
    I mean, if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe, and we&#x27;ll need to start 
turning Jupiter into cells.
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard.
    Delays happen.
    What contingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter while renting internal 
cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y production volume targets in Berlin and 
Texas?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So I think it&#x27;s -- we&#x27;re trying to derisk to <span class="r3">2021</span> so that there&#x27;s almost no dependency on our internal cell 
production.
    It&#x27;s very, very small.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">11</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">1421</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Right.
    Basically, production of <span class="r3">4680</span> ramp is growing exponentially.
    And yes, it’s going well.
    We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

<span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span>

Elon Musk

Yes.
    And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in 
United States alone by Tesla, not including , will be on top of that.
    Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get <span class="r3">300</span> to <span class="r3">400</span> terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is </span><span class="r6">300</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span>
<span class="r6">to </span><span class="r6">400</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> gigawatt hours or </span><span class="r6">300</span><span class="r6"> to </span><span class="r6">400</span><span class="r6"> terawatt hours.</span>
    Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high 
tonnage and then some nickel.
    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
    And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">12</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2031</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question.
    So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact.
    It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter.
    And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping 
up pretty well, right?
    And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter.
    In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other 
established factory, which is Fremont.
    So that was a positive in the quarter.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there.</span>
    And that product has done well.
    I mean, on the cost curve also, we’ve been able to do a lot there.
    But I do want to caution that Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy.
    So yes, we had a great quarter this period.
    But depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods where

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think you&#x27;re probably right about that.
    I mean, RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;re already seeing this in Australia, where we&#x27;re seeing behind-the-meter aggregation that is providing 
grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customer and reduces the prices for the grid 
operator.
    So you&#x27;re seeing this trend happening across the globe.
    And it&#x27;s going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those </span><span class="r6">2</span><span class="r6"> working together in tandem and the software </span>
<span class="r6">layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware </span>
<span class="r6">platform and software together.</span>
    RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like 
we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
    So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we&#x27;re continuing to make money off of that power plant.
    Philippe Houchois

Okay.
    Thank you.
    And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration 
approach.
    It&#x27;s very interesting.
    And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla 
Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?

<span class="r6">deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.</span>
    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span class="r3">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span class="r3">27.9</span>%.
    Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span class="r3">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.

    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding energy storage, we deployed </span><span class="r6">4</span><span class="r6"> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.</span>
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r3">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.

    And then with Optimus, we showed a massive improvement in Optimus dexterity improvement on October <span class="r3">10</span>.
    And our next-gen hand and forearm, which is <span class="r3">22</span> degrees of freedom, which is double the prior hand or forearm, it&#x27;s 
extremely human-like, and so it&#x27;s much better at tactile sensing.
    It&#x27;s really -- I feel confident in saying that we have the most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot.
    And we&#x27;re moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots.
    Because the things that -- what other companies are missing is that they&#x27;re missing the AI brain, that they&#x27;re 
missing people to really scale to very high-volume production.
    So, you see some impressive video demos, but what like the localized AI and the volume to very high numbers.
    As I&#x27;ve said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be the most valuable part, so I think has a 
good chance of being the most viable product that we made.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the energy business, that&#x27;s doing extremely well.</span>
    And the opportunity ahead is gigantic.
    The Lathrop Megapack factory reached <span class="r3">200</span> Megapacks a week, which is now a <span class="r3">40</span>-gigawatt hour a year run rate.
    And we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with the <span class="r3">20</span>-gigawatt hour a year run rate in Q1 next year 
so next quarter.
    And that will also scale out.
    It won&#x27;t be long before we&#x27;re shipping <span class="r3">100</span>-gigawatt hours a year stationary storage at Tesla.
    And will that -- I mean, that will ultimately grow, I think, to multiple terawatt hours per year.
    It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r3">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r6">a </span><span class="r6">50</span><span class="r6">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r3">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, </span><span class="r6">500</span><span class="r6">-mile range.</span>
    Just to be clear, <span class="r3">500</span> miles with the cargo.
    Yes, <span class="r3">500</span> miles with the cargo on level ground.
    Yes, sure.
    Not up.
    It’s excellent.
    But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
    And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.

    For PowerWall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seek increased reliability and 
backup home generation.
    We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer 
orders.
    We&#x27;re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are 
providing services back to the grid when they don&#x27;t need to consume energy or have backup power.
    This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r3">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the </span>
<span class="r6">technology backbone of the company.</span>
    Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation 
process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

    Where is it going to be made?
    How is it going to be shipped?
    How is it going to be assembled into the vehicle?
    At any one point if something is done in the silo, it becomes a bottleneck of either cost or time or efficiency, but
with the robotaxi development, like we&#x27;ve done a good job on the combining all that and then like blowing up how it&#x27;s 
made and saying it should be made this way and rethinking it also that it&#x27;s the most efficient factory possible.
    That shows our -- it will see our capex efficiency when we deploy it shows in the number of parts, simplicity of 
vehicle but also help performance in terms of like end user state.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah.
    Just to close out, just on the emerging front also in &#x27;<span class="r3">25</span>, we will have started manufacturing of car.

    Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as 
the product reaches full capacity.
    We have more demand than supply through <span class="r3">2021</span> and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedented demand 
across the globe through <span class="r3">2023</span> and beyond.
    Our order book is rapidly filling up through <span class="r3">2023</span> in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.
    Large scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation in many locations 
across the globe.
    This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will further displace existing and new fossil fuel generation.
    This is true for standalone storage as well.
    Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware and software with advanced 
real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market where deployed.

    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r3">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r3">500</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions

    I&#x27;m Carl, I&#x27;m on the Solar Roof engineering and installation.
    The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and 
experienced.
    We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we&#x27;re continuing to hire.
    The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site.
    We&#x27;ve talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every 
installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips.
    Also, we&#x27;ve had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they&#x27;re ramping up installations for Solar 
Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.

<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">I mean, here&#x27;s the way to think about that product, in my opinion.</span>

    When you look around the neighborhood future, decade from now, what do you want?
    What products are going to make your life better?
    What future do you want?
    And I think a future where we&#x27;ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better 
in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy.
    That&#x27;s the future we want.

    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
    Now, we&#x27;ll go to investor questions.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year, as mentioned by Elon </span>
<span class="r6">earlier?</span>
    And how does it align with your AI and product road map?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    I mean, as Elon and Vaibhav both said, we are on plan to meet that in the first half of next year.
    Ambition has always been to lower the cost of our vehicles to increase the adoption of sustainable energy and 
transport.
    Part of that is lowering the cost of our current vehicles, which is where all of the personally owned vehicles that 
we sell today come in.
    But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the 
initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that&#x27;s really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI 
road map.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.

    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r3">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r6">2.3</span><span class="r6"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r6">2024</span><span class="r6">, representing </span><span class="r6">28</span><span class="r6">% growth </span>
<span class="r6">versus </span><span class="r6">2023</span><span class="r6"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r3">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r3">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r3">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r3">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.

    The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it 
comes to real world AI.
    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
    And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
    Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy </span>
<span class="r6">business.</span>
    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span class="r3">37</span>,<span class="r3">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.

    Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
    Elon Musk

Not at this time.
    Rod Lache

Okay.
    And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a 
vacuum.
    And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting 
the law of large numbers on some of your products.
    Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment?
    And any thoughts along those lines?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.</span>
    I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they’re very 
unlikely to.
    It’s worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, they’re actually very difficult 
for the average person to access because they -- most people do not have $<span class="r3">10</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> or even $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">500</span>, burning a hole in their
bank account.
    A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt.
    They’ve got credit card debt, mortgage debt.
    So, that’s reality for most people.
    It’s sometimes difficult for people who are high income and I’d say high to be like someone who’s earning over 
$<span class="r3">200</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $<span class="r3">50</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> or $<span class="r3">60</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> or $<span class="r3">70</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a year, which 
is most people.
    So like for a lot of people, like this tax credit just -- they can’t front $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">500</span> for <span class="r3">18</span> months or even <span class="r3">6</span> months to 
get -- for the tax credit, and they actually don’t, in some case, even have that $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">500</span> in taxes.
