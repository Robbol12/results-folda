[TSLA_Q1_2023] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #100] [PLAN]
     So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage.
     If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
     So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
     So that is in line with expectations.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
     I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.
>>> I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business.
     Relative to total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small.
     And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there.
     But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it.
     I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we'll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
     I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let's go to the battery question.

2. [Sentence #71] [PLAN]
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.
     This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
     We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
     Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year.
     Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
>>> We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
     And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
     To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And let's go to investor questions on say.com.
     The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
     What variables do you consider?
-----
3. [Sentence #91] [PLAN]
     It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
     But it's -- and unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that's right.
     I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
     But it is something that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
>>> And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
     Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
     So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage.
     If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
     So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
     So that is in line with expectations.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.

4. [Sentence #428] [UNCERTAIN]
     And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
     I mean, obviously, there's a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
     And can you talk about the volume of quotation you're seeing at this point around stationary storage for the renewables queue on a global basis?
     And how much of that is converting into actual sales?
     Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
     Andrew Baglino

I mean -- yes, I don't -- that's also not exactly how we look at it, really.
     We're not like -- yes, we're not engaged in the interconnection queue.
>>> Like we're focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our own projects.
     And we're mostly just -- we're being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our mission and our objectives.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     This -- again, this is not a product call, but we'll have something, I mean, this -- we're making improvements on many fronts, including Megapacks.
     So I think some of those improvements will improve the speed at which you can connect the Megapacks to the grid.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
     Mark Delaney

Yes.

5. [Sentence #67] [PLAN]
     Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
     Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
     However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes.
     Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries.
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.

     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.

6. [Sentence #34] [PILOT]
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
>>> Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.
     This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
     And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
     There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year.
     And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
     So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
     Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
     We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.

7. [Sentence #94] [PLAN]
     I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
     But it is something that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.

8. [Sentence #288] [PLAN]
     Like instead of making a picture-sharing app, please, we're trying, lithium, mining and refining, heavy industry, come on.
     Karn Budhiraj

It's fun.
     It's actually fun.
     Elon Musk

Yes, yes.
     Exactly.
     For real.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

That's we're here, ready to buy.
>>> Elon Musk

It's -- Tesla is not famous because we want to do it.
     We have a lot of fish to fry, obviously, but we're doing it because others aren't doing it, and we wish others would do it.
     Martin Viecha

Awesome.
     Thank you very much.
     Let's go to Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Can you hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes, we can.
     Yes.

9. [Sentence #33] [PILOT]
     As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.

10. [Sentence #163] [PLAN]
     In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but the expectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.
     There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
     Within the world that we don't control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage of reduced spot rates where they can.
     So thank you to our supply chain team.
     And then there's the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, two years or so, and we're still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
     It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
     We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
>>> We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.
     It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
     And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
     How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
