this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
    I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business.</span>
    Relative to total revenues of the company, it&#x27;s still fairly small.
    And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the 
small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there.
    But as this business grows and smooths out, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re that far away from it.
    I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we&#x27;ll start doing
and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
    I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let&#x27;s go to the battery question.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">71</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span class="r5">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">91</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">428</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
    I mean, obviously, there&#x27;s a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?
    And how much of that is converting into actual sales?
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

I mean -- yes, I don&#x27;t -- that&#x27;s also not exactly how we look at it, really.
    We&#x27;re not like -- yes, we&#x27;re not engaged in the interconnection queue.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Like we&#x27;re focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the </span>
<span class="r5">pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our</span>
<span class="r5">own projects.</span>
    And we&#x27;re mostly just -- we&#x27;re being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our 
mission and our objectives.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This -- again, this is not a product call, but we&#x27;ll have something, I mean, this -- we&#x27;re making improvements on 
many fronts, including Megapacks.
    So I think some of those improvements will improve the speed at which you can connect the Megapacks to the grid.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
    Mark Delaney

Yes.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">67</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.

<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">34</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our energy storage deployment reached nearly </span><span class="r5">4</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours in Q1.</span>
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span> rate of <span class="r3">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r3">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving 
beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Karn Budhiraj

It&#x27;s fun.
    It&#x27;s actually fun.
    Elon Musk

Yes, yes.
    Exactly.
    For real.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

That&#x27;s we&#x27;re here, ready to buy.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">It&#x27;s -- Tesla is not famous because we want to do it.</span>
    We have a lot of fish to fry, obviously, but we&#x27;re doing it because others aren&#x27;t doing it, and we wish others would
do it.
    Martin Viecha

Awesome.
    Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Can you hear me?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, we can.
    Yes.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">9</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">33</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.</span>
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r3">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r2">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r2">]</span> rate of <span class="r3">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.

<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">163</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don&#x27;t need to rehash it, but the expectation is that 
every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.
    There&#x27;s also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we&#x27;re 
aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
    Within the world that we don&#x27;t control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in 
our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage 
of reduced spot rates where they can.
    So thank you to our supply chain team.
    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We think there&#x27;ll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...</span>

<span class="r5">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Lithium has dropped a lot.</span>
    It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And that&#x27;s the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
    And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the 
second half of the year.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
