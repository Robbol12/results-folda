[Year Q1] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #147]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Elon** Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
2. [Sentence #202]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Question number one, **Elon** has mentioned a 50% compound annual **growth** target for Tesla in the past.
3. [Sentence #277]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Powerwall**, **Powerpack**, **Megapack**.
4. [Sentence #338]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Elon** Musk

I think, it's high time we invested in infrastructure in this country.
5. [Sentence #521]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) I think like – I can't remember – I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you've always mentioned that demand for **energy** **storage** is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you can make.
6. [Sentence #526]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And so to really grow the ****energy** **storage** **business****, it's all about cell investments.
7. [Sentence #533]  --- TSLA_Q1_2021 ---

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla First Quarter 2021 Results and Q&A Webcast.
8. [Sentence #658]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) **Elon** Musk

So, yeah, so it’s basically saying that the, like, right now people think of Tesla has -- a lot of people think Tesla is a car company or perhaps an **energy** company.
9. [Sentence #861]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) **Elon** Musk

There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the **energy** **storage** problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.
10. [Sentence #966]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) We are seeing a lot of…

**Elon** Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in **storage** as in vehicles.
11. [Sentence #968]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) So we are already are at good margins with the **Powerwall**, but some additional work is needed for the **Megapack** to achieve good margins.
12. [Sentence #977]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) We have been producing **Powerwall** 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but **Megapack** has more room to go to achieve our **targets**.
13. [Sentence #978]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) **Elon** Musk

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the **Megapack**.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s First Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast.
15. [Sentence #1119]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s **growth**.
16. [Sentence #1298]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) **Elon** Musk

Ramp production faster than Shanghai because we have learned a lot.
17. [Sentence #1371]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) **Elon** Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.
18. [Sentence #1483]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) **Elon** Musk

Do we expect to expand?
19. [Sentence #1646]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Our **energy** **storage** deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.
20. [Sentence #1679]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) This **business** is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our **Megapack** products.
21. [Sentence #1683]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, ****energy** **storage** **business**** and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
22. [Sentence #1703]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) And when will you provide more formal guidance on **Megapack** and overall Tesla **Energy**?
23. [Sentence #1706]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable **energy** economy, there is more stationary **energy** **storage** needed than there is mobile **energy** **storage**.
24. [Sentence #1712]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) I say **storage** is a combination of both the **Megapack** **business** and the **Powerwall** **business**.
25. [Sentence #1900]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) **Elon** Musk

It's -- Tesla is not famous because we want to do it.
26. [Sentence #2040]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Like we're focused on ramping **Megapack** as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the pipelines of a variety of different renewable **energy** and just pure stationary **storage** developers and we also develop our own projects.
27. [Sentence #2212]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and **energy** **storage** deployments, the **Megapack** in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the **energy** **business**, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
28. [Sentence #2263]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Our **Energy** **business** continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.
29. [Sentence #2264]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We expect the **energy** **storage** deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.
30. [Sentence #2831]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) **Elon** Musk

So, thank you for helping Tesla to get to where it is today over seven years.
