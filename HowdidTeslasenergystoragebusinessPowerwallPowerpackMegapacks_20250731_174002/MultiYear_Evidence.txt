[Multi-Year Analysis] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and **energy** **storage** deployments, the **Megapack** in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the **energy** **business**, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
2. [Sentence #18]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, you see, we all have -- the ****energy** **storage** **business**** is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both **Megapack** and **Powerwall**.
3. [Sentence #29]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Similar dynamics are also playing out in our **storage** **business** as we are working to expand **Powerwall** and **Megapack** production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
4. [Sentence #30]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The ****energy** **storage** **business**** delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before.
5. [Sentence #55]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with **energy** **business** leading the charge, primarily from the **growth** in **Megapack** deployments.
6. [Sentence #71]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, ****energy** **storage** **business**** and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
7. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) The **Energy** **business** had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial **storage**.
8. [Sentence #82]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Our **storage** **business** remains component-constrained on both **Powerwall** and **Megapack**, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year.
9. [Sentence #83]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) **Energy** **storage** deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from **Megapack**, but also **Powerwall**, resulting in record revenues and profit for the **energy** **business**.
10. [Sentence #90]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) For our **energy** **business**, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with **Megapack**.
11. [Sentence #91]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) On **energy** profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this **business**, driven primarily by record volumes of our **Megapack** and **Powerwall** products.
12. [Sentence #91]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) And when will you provide more formal guidance on **Megapack** and overall Tesla **Energy**?
13. [Sentence #99]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Our ****energy** **storage** **business**** had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%.
14. [Sentence #100]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) I say **storage** is a combination of both the **Megapack** **business** and the **Powerwall** **business**.
15. [Sentence #108]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) In the **Energy** **business**, our **Megapack** product achieved its first quarterly profit.
16. [Sentence #116]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) In the **Energy** **business**, we achieved record **storage** deployments, aided by the positive reception of the **Megapack** and **Powerwall** products as production and deployments grow.
17. [Sentence #137]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Q3 was a strong quarter for the **Energy** **business**, and we're poised for continued strong **growth** in **Energy** **storage** and solar.
18. [Sentence #138]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) **Megapack** is going to be a large **growth** segment for the **business** and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
19. [Sentence #176]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) **Elon** Musk

Well, Tesla is – Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable **energy**.
20. [Sentence #187]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) This was a result of higher -- sorry, **growth** came from **Megapack** and **Powerwall**.
21. [Sentence #241]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) So that also -- we actually see the ****energy** **storage** **business****, stationary **storage**, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
22. [Sentence #263]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) The first one is, Tesla **Energy** seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite **Elon** comments about **growth** rate exceeding automotive.
23. [Sentence #277]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Powerwall**, **Powerpack**, **Megapack**.
24. [Sentence #286]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) I think the **Megapack** has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid tied **storage** battery of megawatt hour **scale**.
25. [Sentence #330]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) **Elon**, I guess, my question is around the **Megapack** or your **energy** **business**.
26. [Sentence #428]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) Like we're focused on ramping **Megapack** as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the pipelines of a variety of different renewable **energy** and just pure stationary **storage** developers and we also develop our own projects.
27. [Sentence #445]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) We have been producing **Powerwall** 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but **Megapack** has more room to go to achieve our **targets**.
28. [Sentence #445]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) We have been producing **Powerwall** 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but **Megapack** has more room to go to achieve our **targets**.
29. [Sentence #451]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the **Megapack**, in all your ****energy** **storage** **business****?
30. [Sentence #526]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And so to really grow the ****energy** **storage** **business****, it's all about cell investments.
