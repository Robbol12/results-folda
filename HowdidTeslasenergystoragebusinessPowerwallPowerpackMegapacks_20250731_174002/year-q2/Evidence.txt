Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Tesla’s Q2 2020 Financial Results Q&A and Webcast.
2. [Sentence #108]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) In the **Energy** **business**, our **Megapack** product achieved its first quarterly profit.
3. [Sentence #263]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) The first one is, Tesla **Energy** seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite **Elon** comments about **growth** rate exceeding automotive.
4. [Sentence #268]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) I think long term, Tesla **Energy** will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
5. [Sentence #269]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) So, I mean, the **Energy** **business** collectively is bigger than the automotive **business**.
6. [Sentence #286]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) I think the **Megapack** has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid tied **storage** battery of megawatt hour **scale**.
7. [Sentence #290]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) It's an autonomous **energy** market participation system that does high-frequency trading in short...

**Elon** Musk

That's a bad word.
8. [Sentence #309]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) I mean, we've…

**Elon** Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable **energy** problem.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla First Quarter 2021 Results and Q&A Webcast.
10. [Sentence #731]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) **Elon** Musk

So, yeah, so it’s basically saying that the, like, right now people think of Tesla has -- a lot of people think Tesla is a car company or perhaps an **energy** company.
11. [Sentence #934]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) **Elon** Musk

There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the **energy** **storage** problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.
12. [Sentence #1039]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) We are seeing a lot of…

**Elon** Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in **storage** as in vehicles.
13. [Sentence #1041]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) So we are already are at good margins with the **Powerwall**, but some additional work is needed for the **Megapack** to achieve good margins.
14. [Sentence #1050]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) We have been producing **Powerwall** 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but **Megapack** has more room to go to achieve our **targets**.
15. [Sentence #1051]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) **Elon** Musk

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the **Megapack**.
16. [Sentence #1210]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) Our **storage** **business** remains component-constrained on both **Powerwall** and **Megapack**, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year.
17. [Sentence #1304]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) **Elon** Musk

Well, Tesla is – Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable **energy**.
18. [Sentence #1456]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) **Elon** Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
19. [Sentence #1474]  (TSLA_Q2_2022) So **Elon**, you always mention this 50% per annum sustainable **growth** target that you guys have.
20. [Sentence #1787]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) For our **energy** **business**, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with **Megapack**.
21. [Sentence #1812]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas **scale** up to date.
22. [Sentence #1814]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla **Energy** products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
23. [Sentence #1817]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) **Megapack** continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023.
24. [Sentence #2021]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) **Elon** Musk

Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive **business**, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology.
25. [Sentence #2220]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) **Elon** Musk

Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.
26. [Sentence #2279]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) **Energy** **storage** deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the **energy** **business**.
27. [Sentence #2308]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) For the **energy** **business**, this is growing faster than anything else.
28. [Sentence #2344]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) **Energy** **storage** deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from **Megapack**, but also **Powerwall**, resulting in record revenues and profit for the **energy** **business**.
29. [Sentence #2413]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) The next question is on **energy** **growth**, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one.
30. [Sentence #2502]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) **Elon** Musk

Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined.
