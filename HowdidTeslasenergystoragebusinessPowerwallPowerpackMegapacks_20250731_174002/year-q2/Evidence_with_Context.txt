[Year Q2] How did Tesla’s energy storage business (Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack) scale from 2019 to 2024, and was this growth aligned with Elon Musk’s targets?

1. [Sentence #2344, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
     Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
     Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
>>> Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.
     Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.
     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
     The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.
     Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period.
     And I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials.

2. [Sentence #1210, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     You have embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.
     On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%.
     The temporary decline in Shanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factory restart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.
     Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefficiencies of our new factories, which are progressing well, but have had an impact on margin as those factories come online.
     While we continue to see a benefit from higher pricing flowing through, which experienced some foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increases from inflation, commodities and logistics.
     The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online and progress on unit economics.
>>> Our storage business remains component-constrained on both Powerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of the year.
     We are greatly appreciative of the patience and flexibility shown by our customers while we work through these challenges.
     Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related startup costs have wound down as these factories have moved into production and their costs are now reflected in automotive COGS.
     Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to Fiat for a realized gain, offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&L included within restructuring and other.
     We also incurred restructuring charges related to targeted staffing reductions.
     Elon Musk

Yes, actually, it should be mentioned that the reason we sold a bunch of our Bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate.
     So it was important for us to maximize our cash position, given the uncertainty of the COVID lockdowns in China.
     We are certainly open to increasing our Bitcoin holdings in future.

3. [Sentence #286, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PILOT]
     The battery and solar will both be enormous.
     And they kind of have to be in order to -- for us to have a sustainable future.
     And we've got a great product road map on that front as well.
     So we're going to ship in the Megapack.
     It's very well received.
     Drew, you want to talk about that?
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
>>> I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid tied storage battery of megawatt hour scale.
     We're working with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also just like microgrid and project developers of all type, and building our own projects where it makes sense.
     And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product.
     And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-type batteries.
     It's an autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading in short...

Elon Musk

That's a bad word.
     Drew Baglino

Sorry.
     Elon Musk

How should free instant energy called front running.
     We're not doing that.
-----
4. [Sentence #108, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
     With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
     The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
     Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
     While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
     Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
>>> In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
     We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity.
     And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
     Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2.
     This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A within operating expenses.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which included free cash flows of over $400 million.
     This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital.
     A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.

     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Sorry.
     Just jumping in, Elon.
     Absolutely agree.
     Yes.
     Powerwall is mature.
>>> We have been producing Powerwall 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but Megapack has more room to go to achieve our targets.
     Elon Musk

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the Megapack.
     Andrew Baglino

Absolutely.
     Yes, we do.

     Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
     Elon Musk

Well, right now, 0.
     But long term, a lot.
     Drew Baglino

It's our biggest property.
     Elon Musk

Yes, it's biggest property, true.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
>>> The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate exceeding automotive.
     Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
     How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I can't emphasize.
     I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
     So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
     So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector?
-----
7. [Sentence #1304, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, I would really like to encourage, once again, entrepreneurs to enter the lithium refining business.
     You can’t lose.
     It’s licensed to print money.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is you made the right economic call before most on inflation when you diversified into Bitcoin.
     It has since shown it’s not much of a hedge in the real world test in the last few months.
     How do you think about it as an asset over long-term and what do you need to see to change your view?
>>> Elon Musk

Well, Tesla is – Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
     We are not really – cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow.
     So, it’s – we are not a – cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot.
     We think a lot about scaling production and accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, which the record heat waves around earth, so to emphasize the urgency of that transition.
     So that is what we are trying to do is make electric vehicles and solar and stationary storage battery packs.
     But the three pillars of a sustainable energy future, which is like solar and wind for energy generation, stationary battery packs for storage of the solar energy because of its intermittency and then electric vehicles, the third pillar.
     And if those three things are solved, we have a sustainable future for civilization.
     And the fundamental good of Tesla and the reason we’re doing this, so certainly, my primary motivation here is to have the day of sustainable energy comes sooner.
-----
8. [Sentence #1787, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business.
     This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend.
     This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
     Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments.
     This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
     If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
     We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories.
>>> For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack.
     As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones.
     As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades.
     These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
     However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
     It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term.
     Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.
     Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.

     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs.
     So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.
     And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla.
     We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.
     And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.
     Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues.
>>> Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.
     And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
     We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
     But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
     The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
     In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
     So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
     This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.

10. [Sentence #934, TSLA_Q2_2021] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Just like cigarettes and alcohol.
     Just like fruits and vegetables.
     It’s just common sense.
     And on the plus side, I am not suggesting anyone be complacent.
     But sustainable energy, renewable energy, will be sold.
     It is being sold, but it matters how fast we sell this and if we sell it faster, that’s better for the world.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> Elon Musk

There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.
     I want to be clear, zero.
     I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based, lithium-ion cells.
     I will say, lithium-ion, people think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells.
     It’s more like 1% to 2% of the cell is lithium.
     The main part of the cell is the cathode.
     The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode.
     For high energy cells, like, for example, what we use in most Teslas, have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.

     Yes.
     Powerwall is mature.
     We have been producing Powerwall 2 for three years now and we are at good margins there, but Megapack has more room to go to achieve our targets.
>>> Elon Musk

We have a clear runway for improving the cost for the megawatt hours for the Megapack.

     The first question is, how is how is Dojo coming along?
     Could Dojo unlock an AWS-like business line for Tesla over the next few years?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I will jump in here.
     So with respect to…

Elon Musk

Sorry about that.
     My apologies.
     I was on mute.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Go ahead, Elon.
>>> Elon Musk

So, yeah, so it’s basically saying that the, like, right now people think of Tesla has -- a lot of people think Tesla is a car company or perhaps an energy company.
     I think long-term people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company.
     I think we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world and so we appear to be able to do things with Self-Driving that others cannot.
     So and if you look at the evolution of what technologies we have developed, we developed them in order to solve the problem of Self-Driving.
     So we couldn’t find a powerful enough neural net computer, so we designed and built our own.
     The software out there was really quite primitive for this task and so we built a team from scratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in the world.
     And then it sort of makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the road system is designed for a neural net computer, our brain.
     Our brain is a neural net computer.

13. [Sentence #1039, TSLA_Q2_2021] [PLAN]
     We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     And I had a quick follow-up on – maybe, Zach, for you on your Energy business.
     So I understand like the negative gross margin with Solar Roof ran.
     But I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the Storage business and where are you -- what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business?
     I guess it’s going to grow in the mix in coming years, so it’s important for long-term modeling.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
>>> We are seeing a lot of…

Elon Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicles.
     But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than storage.
     So we are already are at good margins with the Powerwall, but some additional work is needed for the Megapack to achieve good margins.
     Yes, Drew, what do you think?
     Operator

Thank you.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Sorry.
     Just jumping in, Elon.
-----
14. [Sentence #2308, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
     And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year.
     This will be for Tesla consumption.
     It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
     But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories.
     And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers.
     That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus.
>>> For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
     So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
     So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
     We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
     The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
     I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
     Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
-----
15. [Sentence #309, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     And then the batteries, the computers like all interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make the grid smooth.
     And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working together and interacting with third-party systems as well.
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
     Essentially, are distributed.
     It does both.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
>>> I mean, we've…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
     Drew Baglino

Yes, you can't plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
     You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that's what we're doing.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.
     That's the real limit.
     So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint.
     And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
-----
16. [Sentence #290, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PILOT]
     It's very well received.
     Drew, you want to talk about that?
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
     I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid tied storage battery of megawatt hour scale.
     We're working with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also just like microgrid and project developers of all type, and building our own projects where it makes sense.
     And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product.
     And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-type batteries.
>>> It's an autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading in short...

Elon Musk

That's a bad word.
     Drew Baglino

Sorry.
     Elon Musk

How should free instant energy called front running.
     We're not doing that.
     Drew Baglino

Not doing anything like that.
     No, it's ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to manage the grid intermittency of the renewals -- renewables and just grid intermittency of all kinds.
     I mean, people turn their lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up and down and batteries are great to solve those problems.

Yes.

     But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term.
     So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at.
     I mean, Zachary?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I fully agree with you.
     I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest.
     And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense.
     It’s intense in terms of investment; it’s intense in terms of potential.
>>> Elon Musk

Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology.
     That is super hard.
     Unidentified Company Representative

And vertical integration.
     It’s not even just like new products, but also...

Elon Musk

Yes.
     We actually make our share...

Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest.
     That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction.
     Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest?
     Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we’ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and with -- a set of that we’ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash.

Okay.
     Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
     It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
>>> Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
     The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
     And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain.
     The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount battery output per year?
     This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
     So yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
     I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.

Okay.
     And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
     The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate exceeding automotive.
     Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
     How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I can't emphasize.
>>> I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
     So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
     So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector?
     Bigger than automotive.
     And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and followed by wind.
     And those are intermittent.
     So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the solar energy, because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine.
     So there's like three elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energy generation; battery storage; and electric transport, those three things.

     Elon Musk

People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition to sustainability?
     The answer is no.
     Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could fully transition Earth to sustainable energy.
     The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production.
     How fast can that grow?
     It’s growing fast with the faster it grows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy.
     Pierre Ferragu

This is actually a great exactly where my follow-up is.
>>> So Elon, you always mention this 50% per annum sustainable growth target that you guys have.
     And so my question here is when we see like the difficulty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging prices, I’m kind of wondering, as you are planning for this 50% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next 5 to 10 years, how much of that do you feel you’ve secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts and things like that?
     And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business.
     So does that mean you don’t have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over multiple years?
     And what’s – how much of that is secured today?
     And how fast can you improve that basically?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think it’s very difficult to predict anything 10 years from now.
     I hope civilization is still around, frankly.

     That’s completely amortized.
     So, we’ll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away.
     And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do.
     So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement.
     Of course, the commodities spiked up and down.
     Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I’m totally agreeing.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And they’re recovering now.
     Karn Budhiraj

Cobalt -- the way it used to be.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And we’re still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost down curve of Austin and Berlin.
     And so, it takes time to work the cost out it.
     First, it’s a focus on ramp -- ramp, it brings cost down...

Elon Musk

And quality costs…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

     Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production.
     That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
     As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell.
     Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis.
     We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
     Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?

     Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
     Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023.
     As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target margins.
     The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024.
     We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour today, actually.
     We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

     Ben Kallo

Hi.
     Thanks for taking my question.
     When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term?
     And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue?
     And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware.
     Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars?
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Musk

Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined.
     So, it's simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it.
     I think everyone on earth is going to want one.
     There's 8 billion people on earth, so it's 8 billion right there.
     Then you've got, all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more.
     So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units.
     And Tesla is -- that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not.
     And we've got a lot of experience -- with the most experienced with the world leaders in real world AI.

     So, congrats to the team for that.
     Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.

     On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
     In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
     Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.

     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I would say something.
     Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers.
     Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging.
     We've spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy.
     We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one.
     What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
     Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
     I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.
     Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.
     So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
     So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.
     However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.
