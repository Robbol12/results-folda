    We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of <span class="r3">2025</span> and will continue to expand our 
lineup from there.
    From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it

deployments year over year in <span class="r3">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.

    Great.
    Alrighty.
    And our last question will be coming from Dan Levy at Barclays.
    Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Dan Levy -- Analyst

Great.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon, you&#x27;ve talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as sort of broader push to</span>
<span class="r5">sustainable energy.</span>
    I know we&#x27;ve heard a lot about President Trump&#x27;s plans to reverse the EV mandate.
    And I think there&#x27;s a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the U.S.
    So, what would be your view on the right policy in the U.S., given your comments in the past that the need to push 
for sustainable transport?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable.
    I&#x27;m highly confident all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it&#x27;s simply -- it can 
be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine or one could 
have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine.
    Like even if you&#x27;ve been the biggest advocate on Earth, like of the way on these newfangled car automobiles, you 
can&#x27;t stop the advent of automobile.
    It&#x27;s going to happen.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">208</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span class="r3">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
    Our free cash flow for the quarter was $<span class="r3">2</span> billion, and despite capex increase of over $<span class="r3">2.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2024</span>, we were 
able to generate free cash flow of $<span class="r3">3.6</span> billion for the year.
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span class="r3">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span class="r3">5</span> billion.
    And for <span class="r3">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, like Elon said, </span><span class="r5">2025</span><span class="r5"> is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.</span>
    There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the 
pace for the next phase of growth.
    And it is something which now I&#x27;m getting out on the floor, it is going to be out of this world.
    And we just are putting right foundation.
    And that&#x27;s all I have.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
    Now, we will move over to investor questions and we&#x27;ll start with say.com.

    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.
    All right.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon.
    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I&#x27;ll talk about things on Earth.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro </span>
<span class="r5">environment.</span>
    We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
    For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who 
helped us achieve this.
    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.

    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span class="r3">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span class="r3">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
    I think it&#x27;s really similar to Optimus.
    It&#x27;s going to be set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than any
other transportation you could have.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, at that point, when we&#x27;re at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla&#x27;s revenue.</span>
    Might be difficult to say how much.
    you want to add.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

No.
    I mean, I do think that Tesla Semi, again with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable.
    That we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America, that&#x27;s one of the limiting factors on transport.
    And people are human so they get tired and sometimes there&#x27;s -- I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because 
it&#x27;s a tough job.
    But because it&#x27;s a tough job, there&#x27;s not that many people that want to do it.

    And so, it&#x27;s really something special.
    So, yes.
    And my prediction, long term, is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company.
    Regarding energy back to Earth, can we come back there for a minute?
    Back to Earth as energy storage is a big deal and will become -- really super important, will become incredibly 
important in the future.
    And it is something that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible because the grids 
are -- the vast majority of the grid has no energy storage capability.
    So, they have to design the power plants to -- for very high peaks and assuming that there&#x27;s no energy storage.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Once you have grid energy storage and home-based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid</span>
<span class="r5">is dramatically greater than people think.</span>
    Maybe it&#x27;s at least double.
    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span class="r3">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
