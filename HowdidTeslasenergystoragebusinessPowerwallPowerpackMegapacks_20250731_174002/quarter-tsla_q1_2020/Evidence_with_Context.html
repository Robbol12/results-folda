Thanks.
    And I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well.
    I think like – I can&#x27;t remember – I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you&#x27;ve always mentioned 
that demand for energy storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you can make.
    And so I&#x27;m kind of thinking there will be – there should be an inflection point in that business at some point, and 
it&#x27;s going to be driven by your ability to add much more manufacturing capacity like battery manufacturing capacity.
    And at a high level, how are you thinking about that inflection point in terms of time line?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

In terms of time line, I think what we&#x27;ve been doing with both our partners and internally is looking at how to reduce 
the – fundamentally the cost of investments in new sales capacity because when you look at a car – a vehicle product, 
there&#x27;s a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells.
    When you look at an energy storage product, it&#x27;s really just the cells.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so to really grow the energy storage business, it&#x27;s all about cell investments.</span>
    And so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been focused on.
    And I think not to give too much away, but that will be one of the things we address in Battery Investor Day is how 
we&#x27;re focused on that.
    And when we have that in the place we want, it will be a lot easier to scale that business.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much for all your great questions.
    Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today, and we&#x27;ll speak to you again in three months&#x27; time.
    Thank you very much, and have a good day.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
    So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new 
Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.</span>
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span class="r3">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and
most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
    It&#x27;s not out of the question, but our brand is full.
    Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">202</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Question number one, Elon has mentioned a </span><span class="r6">50</span><span class="r6">% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.</span>
    Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to <span class="r3">10</span> years?
    This would be <span class="r3">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2025</span> and more than <span class="r3">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r3">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r3">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r3">40</span>%.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">338</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Yes.
    Adam Jonas

Elon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country.
    My fault for you on this.
    There have been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the U.S. economy in the early 1930s when Roosevelt began 
a series of new deals and infrastructure projects or post-World War <span class="r3">2</span> when Eisenhower launched the U.S. Highway Act and 
JFK launched the Apollo Program, which you could say was influenced by the Cold War, clearly, and you benefited from and
our space program benefited from.
    What would be your message to U.S. lawmakers on this call as we – in addition to your opinion on shelter in place, 
but thinking the longer term, your message to U.S. lawmakers coming out of the crisis, specifically around EV 
infrastructure and a chance to work with taxpayers to support sustainable transport and renewable energy?
    I&#x27;m wondering if you see this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain.
    Thanks.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">I think, it&#x27;s high time we invested in infrastructure in this country.</span>
    We have a lot of a crumbling highways and bridges.
    And frankly, when I visit China, I see their infrastructure as being much better than ours.
    It&#x27;s great.
    Europe has better infrastructure.
    It&#x27;s really quite sad that U.S. infrastructure especially it’s roads and highways is where it is today.
    And our airports, in a lot of cases, are an embarrassment.
    So -- and it&#x27;s not just a question of money.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">521</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r5">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    I haven&#x27;t specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
    We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.
    And in particular, S and X gross margins continue to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed 
cost amortization.
    So there&#x27;s good progress happening, both on the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for our products and 
production.
    And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross profit contribution to the company once we get through 
these inefficiencies, we get them on up and running again, we increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and 
continue to execute on cost reductions on our products, we feel very optimistic about that path going forward.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thanks.
    And I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think like – I can&#x27;t remember – I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you&#x27;ve always mentioned </span>

<span class="r4">6</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">147</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r3">19</span>?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.</span>
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
    But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
    Anything you guys want to add?
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">7</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">86</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.</span>
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
