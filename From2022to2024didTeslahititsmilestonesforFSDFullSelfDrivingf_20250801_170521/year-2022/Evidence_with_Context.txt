[Year 2022] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #1009, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO [ph], and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
     But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
     And so that’s why I am confident we will get to 5,000 cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin, go ahead please.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
>>> Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
     I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it.
     Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
     The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
     It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
     Colin Rusch

Great.

2. [Sentence #1160, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
     So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
>>> So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.
     We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.
-----
3. [Sentence #1902, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     And so there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that, just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.
     So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost of insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the guy [ph] goes up to the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas.
     So it's great.
     So it has an amplified effect, very important.
     Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance.
     And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover the cost.
     And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
>>> So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.
     So it's giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
     They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
     But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
     And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
     And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive.
     But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
     So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
-----
4. [Sentence #95, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full self-driving.
     And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
     The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
     And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
     And I think we will achieve that this year.
>>> The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
     So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate of improvement with every release.
     And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
     And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
     But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
     So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
-----
5. [Sentence #1154, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
     We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
     And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
     We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
>>> Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.

6. [Sentence #1443, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
     Colin, go ahead and unmute.
     Colin Langan

Can you hear me now?
     Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
     Colin Langan

Okay.
     Sorry about that.
>>> Any update on full self-driving?
     I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year.
     Is that still possible?
     Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you’re talking about?
     And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you’d have to think about?
     Elon Musk

We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year.
     So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval.
     It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.
-----
7. [Sentence #1262, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
     We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
     At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
-----
8. [Sentence #2052, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     This, I guess, for Zach.
     Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
     But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
     There's enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
     We fully recognize that.
>>> Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we've released a portion of that.
     And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there.
     And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.
     Alex Potter

Okay, great.
     And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning.
     That's a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi.
     So I guess, two questions about that incremental capacity.
     First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your entire range of products?
-----
9. [Sentence #1159, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.

     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.
-----
10. [Sentence #1823, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
     As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022.
     But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
     The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is.
     And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
     And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we're primarily managing to now.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
     So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.
     So that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin.
     And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
     And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
     That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
     Yeah.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
-----
11. [Sentence #90, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to first investor question.
     And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
     We love his optimism for 2022 release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their own conclusions on progress being made?
     Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
>>> Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full self-driving.
     And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
     The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
     And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
     And I think we will achieve that this year.
     The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
     So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate of improvement with every release.
     And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
-----
12. [Sentence #1667, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Thank you.
     And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
     William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors.
     FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
     Elon Musk

We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%.
     And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there.
     And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control.
>>> But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.
     You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
     In fact, we almost are there.
     And so, we’re probably -- achieving that 100%.
     The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, 100%.
     Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs.
     So the jury is out on Dojo.
     Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training.
-----
13. [Sentence #2027, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
     So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
     I'm just guessing here.
     So, this is -- that would be my guess.
     Pierre Ferragu

Thank you, so much.
     So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout.
     And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today?
>>> So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the take rate?
     Elon Musk

The trend is very strong towards use of FSD.
     And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases.
     And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies.
     This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
     With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, five years old from the design point.
     And Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that, where there are significant leaps.
     And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.
-----
14. [Sentence #685, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Will this be a v11 or later version?
     If the latter, can you explain what makes it a difficult problem in layman terms?
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     This answer will be understood by 0.0 -- 01% of the audience, I think.
     I suppose you wanted to know what a unified vector space would actually mean.
     It essentially would be if you can take – if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at the neural net level, then you don’t need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.
     That is an architecturally better way to – that’s the most desirable outcome.
>>> It’s – I think it’s probably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in the efficiency of the self-driving.
     And it’s certainly something we want to get to.
     Yes.
     The sort of nirvana situation is you have surround video/audio labeling of all static and dynamic objects.
     And you have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well.
     Then that’s – I mean, I think we are almost certainly there before the end of the year.
     Yes, I am not sure how many of you would understand that.
     I should say also, we are also confident of improving the frame rate as we delete some of the legacy neural nets.
-----
15. [Sentence #1719, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     So, basically, price really matters.
     I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it.
     And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
     It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is.
     And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so.
     And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
     We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah.
>>> With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
     This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
     And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
     And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
     Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
     So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
-----
16. [Sentence #586, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PILOT]
     But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170 cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year.
     So we are not dependent on 4680.
     4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
     That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas.
     And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
     Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over 100,000 owners.
     They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.
>>> We have now driven over 35 million miles with FSD beta.
     That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than any – all other companies combined.
     So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
     With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to become the best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage.
     We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
     And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.
     And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do.
     We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that’s manufacturing.
-----
17. [Sentence #1664, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     No doubt.
     Elon Musk

We don’t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
     William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors.
     FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
>>> Elon Musk

     But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.
     You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
     In fact, we almost are there.
     And so, we’re probably -- achieving that 100%.
     The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, 100%.

18. [Sentence #2049, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes

Alex Potter

Okay, great.
     So a quick one on FSD.
     This, I guess, for Zach.
     Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
     But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
>>> I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
     There's enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
     We fully recognize that.
     Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we've released a portion of that.
     And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there.
     And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.

Okay, great.
     And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning.

     I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it.
     And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
     It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is.
     And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so.
     And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.
     We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah.
     With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America.
>>> This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.
     And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways.
     And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear.
     So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
     Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
     Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers.
     So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
     Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.

20. [Sentence #1155, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
     We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
     And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
     We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
>>> Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
     So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
     So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
