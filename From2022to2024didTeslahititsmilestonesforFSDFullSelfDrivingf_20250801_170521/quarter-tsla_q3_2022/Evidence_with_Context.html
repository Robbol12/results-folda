    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
    So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">this year, probably about a month from now.</span>
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
    Let’s see, with respect to demand.
    We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
    I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far 
into future as we can see.
    So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins 
strong.
    We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.

    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell.
    And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant 
portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
    Colin, go ahead and unmute.
    Colin Langan

Can you hear me now?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
    Colin Langan

Okay.
    Sorry about that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Any update on full self-driving?</span>
    I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year.
    Is that still possible?
    Is it -- would it still be like a Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> or Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> that you’re talking about?
    And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you’d have to think about?
    Elon Musk

We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by 
the end of this year.
    So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval.
    It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.

    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
    We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at
a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or greater compound annual growth rate.
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

    William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success
in each of the three major AI endeavors.
    FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
    Elon Musk

We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there.
    And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our 
control.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of </span>

    You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
    In fact, we almost are there.
    And so, we’re probably -- achieving that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA 
continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs.
    So the jury is out on Dojo.
