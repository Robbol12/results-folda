start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">52</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
    As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span class="r2">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
    We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we
are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span class="r2">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.</span>
    We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
    So basically, there is a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year.
    And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times.
    Super appreciate it.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

    But we have line of sight to solve for the volumes being contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.
    And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record output from our partners 
and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories.
    We’ve grown cell production significantly on a <span class="r2">12</span>-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our 
partners for key battery metals.
    So we don’t see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add on the profitability part of the question.
    Q2 was our largest increase yet over the last handful of quarters on inflation and commodity-related increases to 
our cars.
    It’s fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply
chain.
    So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year.
    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I’d like to ask like a question on <span class="r2">4680</span> and the structural battery pack.
    And I’d love to understand where you stand on the technology and efficiency and energy density road map that you 
described at the Battery Day.
    So what I’m trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of the battery cell itself?
    How much silicon do you have in it?
    How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far?
    Sorry.
    And the reason why I’m asking – sorry.
