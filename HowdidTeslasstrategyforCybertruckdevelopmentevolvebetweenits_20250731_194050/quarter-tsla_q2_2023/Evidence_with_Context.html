    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> How did Tesla&#x27;s strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its <span class="r2">2019</span> unveiling and its production 
start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">52</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    And we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas.
    And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our 
computer, if they did not have the training data.
    So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net 
training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
    And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a <span class="r2">100</span> exaflops by the end of next year.
    So, to date, over <span class="r2">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span class="r2">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span class="r2">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, <span class="r2">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span class="r5">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span class="r2">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
    And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.

    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.
    Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.
    Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    And let’s go to investor questions.
    The first question on licensing FSD we’ve already answered.
    So, let’s go to the second one.
    The second question is, what is the status of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?
    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production increased <span class="r2">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span class="r2">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span class="r5">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span class="r2">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
    Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span class="r2">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
