[Year 2024] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #88, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
     In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding.
     Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
     And we can open it up to Q&A.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's start with investor Q&A.
     The first question is, what is the status of 4680.
     What is the current output?
     Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Sure.
     4680 production increased about 18% to 20% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
>>> We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four lines in Phase 1, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp.
     Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases.
     So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is on Optimus.
     So what is the current status of Optimus?
     Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
     When do you expect to start mass production?
     Elon Musk

We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab.
     In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year.
     And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year.
     These are just guesses.
     As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.
     Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.
     So that's what is going to happen.
     And I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself.

2. [Sentence #1465, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     And this is what's wrong.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
     Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we're pulling that.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     Most the time, you don't need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
     The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
     And that's why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people don't realize that it has so much capability.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they're not like obviously super futuristic.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
     What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
     So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we're progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory in Reno.
>>> We've released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production.
     Semi growth will largely depend on our customers' adoption of the product.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don't think we're going to be limited, honestly.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
     We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it's about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it's a no brainer.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     Fundamentally, if you've got a Semi, the fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport is better than a diesel truck.
     Any company that doesn't adopt an electric Semi will lose.
     It's not a subjective thing.
     It's like whether do you like just competitive -- we want the stat -- we want to have a good old Semi truck.
     But frankly, if we made a good old Semi truck, would it matter?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

And this is proving so in our fleets, in Pepsi's Partner.
     In fact, the Pepsi actually said last week, they're having -- nobody wants -- their drivers don't want to go back.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.

3. [Sentence #203, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

I think we – Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks.
     But as you mentioned, we’re updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low-cost vehicles in a more CapEx efficient way.
     That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible.
     These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We’ll talk about this more on August 8.
     But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet.
     And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.
     Lars Moravy

5 million cars?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
     Elon already talked about that.
     So we’ll have to wait till August.
     The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
     We already talked about that.

4. [Sentence #87, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
     We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.

     Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.
     So that's what is going to happen.

5. [Sentence #2074, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     So, when you consider, OK, there's more people leaving truck driving as a profession than entering it, well, we're going to have a real logistics problem as time goes by.
     So, autonomy will be very important to meet that need.
     So, like, yes, it will -- I don't know.
     It's a several billion a year opportunity, which I don't know in this context.
     These days, does several billion a year matter?
     I think it does.
     It's not nothing.
     It's probably -- it might displace a $10 billion a year thing.
     That's $1 billion a month at some point probably.
     But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
     So, yes, $1 billion a month is a lot but it's not it's going to be like 1% of Optimus.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
     Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles?
>>> And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's capex?
     I think they're referring to cost there.
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They're really asking the tough questions, aren't they?
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven't started working on Hardware 3 yet.
     We are still making software releases.
     We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously.
     People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
     So, we're not giving up on Hardware.
     We're still working on it.
     Just will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thanks.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done.
     Now I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Elon.
     The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
