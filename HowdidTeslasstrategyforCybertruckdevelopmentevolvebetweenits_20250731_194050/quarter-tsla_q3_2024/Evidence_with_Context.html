    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q3_2024]</span> How did Tesla&#x27;s strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its <span class="r2">2019</span> unveiling and its production 
start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">319</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    And this is what&#x27;s wrong.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
    Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we&#x27;re pulling that.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    Most the time, you don&#x27;t need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
    The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of 
the auto industry.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it&#x27;s underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
    And that&#x27;s why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people 
don&#x27;t realize that it has so much capability.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
    What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in </span>
<span class="r5">the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of </span><span class="r5">2026</span><span class="r5"> and ramping really throughout the year </span>
<span class="r5">to full production.</span>
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it&#x27;s really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
    We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it&#x27;s about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it&#x27;s a no brainer.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
    Fundamentally, if you&#x27;ve got a Semi, the fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport is better than a diesel
truck.
    Any company that doesn&#x27;t adopt an electric Semi will lose.
    It&#x27;s not a subjective thing.
    It&#x27;s like whether do you like just competitive -- we want the stat -- we want to have a good old Semi truck.
    But frankly, if we made a good old Semi truck, would it matter?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

And this is proving so in our fleets, in Pepsi&#x27;s Partner.
    In fact, the Pepsi actually said last week, they&#x27;re having -- nobody wants -- their drivers don&#x27;t want to go back.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
