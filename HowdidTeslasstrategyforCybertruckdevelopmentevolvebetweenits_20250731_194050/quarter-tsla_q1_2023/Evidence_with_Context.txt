[TSLA_Q1_2023] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023â€“2024?

1. [Sentence #175] [PLAN]
     And then there's the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, two years or so, and we're still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
     It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
     We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
     We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.
     It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
     And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
     How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
     Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
     And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think.
     And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
     So it will not be disappointed at all.
     It's amazing.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And let's go to analyst questions.
     We'll start with Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
     Alex, go ahead and unmute.
     Alex Potter

Can you hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Alex Potter

Okay.
     Perfect.

2. [Sentence #71] [PILOT]
     There's three main points I want to make.
     First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
     But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
     In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.
     Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
     Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
     However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes.
     Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries.
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.
     This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
     We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
     Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year.
     Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
>>> We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
     And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
     To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And let's go to investor questions on say.com.
     The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
     What variables do you consider?
     How frequently do you review pricing?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
     Elon Musk

My apologies.
     Sorry, I was on mute.
     Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
     It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
     But it's -- and unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that's right.

3. [Sentence #54] [PILOT]
     So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
     Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
     We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
     Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.
     So, yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy.
     So, we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
     And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
     So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
     In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
     Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
     Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
     And yes, super appreciated.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
>>> I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
     And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
