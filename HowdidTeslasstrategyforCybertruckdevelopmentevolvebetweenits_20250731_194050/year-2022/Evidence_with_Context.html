start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1773</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span class="r2">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
    Second, on cost reduction, we&#x27;re holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead 
efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
    In particular, we&#x27;re accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where 
efficiencies are the highest.
    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span class="r4">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
    I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
    Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1291</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Just try one.
    Epic.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
    What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts?
    And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can take that.
    I think two points on this question.
    The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company.
    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span class="r2">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span class="r6">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply 
chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
    So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">65</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span class="r2">2022</span> versus ‘<span class="r2">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span class="r2">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span class="r2">1</span> million units in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span class="r2">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span class="r2">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span class="r2">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
    Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car
business, worth more than FSD.
    That’s my firm belief.
    So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.
    We expect to address the part shortages that limited our progress with batteries and solar.
    So, we expect batteries and solar to also grow well this year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">609</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
    As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span class="r2">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
    We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we
are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span class="r2">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.</span>
    We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
    So basically, there is a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year.
    And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times.
    Super appreciate it.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1914</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas 
worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it&#x27;s in a collision and for Tesla 
Insurance.
    And previously, we didn&#x27;t actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover 
the cost.
    And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
    So we&#x27;ve actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of
repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla 
comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the 
intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.
    So it&#x27;s giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just 
figuring out how to get -- if somebody&#x27;s cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
    They&#x27;re like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
    But we&#x27;re actually solving how to get somebody&#x27;s car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
    And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
    Like just to emphasize on that, we&#x27;ve started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA,
general assembly, body shops.
    We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?
    How many are needed on each continent?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">610</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

    Thanks, Martin.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1865</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And when do you expect to scale to <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles a year -- a week?
    Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span class="r2">4680</span> team for achieving <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.
    Really, our <span class="r2">2023</span> goal as a <span class="r2">4680</span> team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span class="r2">4680</span> year in
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> cars to Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>?
    Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And to be clear, for </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4">, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into </span>
<span class="r4">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> will so far exceed the average -- 
the safety of the average human.
    So what we&#x27;re aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let&#x27;s say, for argument&#x27;s sake if Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> can be, 
say, <span class="r2">200</span>% or <span class="r2">300</span>% safer than human, Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> might be <span class="r2">500</span>% or <span class="r2">600</span>%.
    It will be Hardware <span class="r2">5</span> beyond that.
    But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
    But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> with Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> is quite significant.
    So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is for Zach.
    Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in 
the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">849</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    But we have line of sight to solve for the volumes being contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.
    And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record output from our partners 
and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories.
    We’ve grown cell production significantly on a <span class="r2">12</span>-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our 
partners for key battery metals.
    So we don’t see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add on the profitability part of the question.
    Q2 was our largest increase yet over the last handful of quarters on inflation and commodity-related increases to 
our cars.
    It’s fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply
chain.
    So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year.
    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I’d like to ask like a question on <span class="r2">4680</span> and the structural battery pack.
    And I’d love to understand where you stand on the technology and efficiency and energy density road map that you 
described at the Battery Day.
    So what I’m trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of the battery cell itself?
    How much silicon do you have in it?
    How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far?
    Sorry.
    And the reason why I’m asking – sorry.
