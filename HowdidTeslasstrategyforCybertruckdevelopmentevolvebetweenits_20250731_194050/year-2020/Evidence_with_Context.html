start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2099</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
    So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
    And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of 
Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue 
probably one level.
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span class="r2">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck </span>
<span class="r5">development?</span>
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span class="r2">8</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span class="r2">6</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons for Model Y.
    So <span class="r2">6</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons was the biggest cast in the world.
    <span class="r2">8</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can start with questions in the queue.
    Operator

Thank you.

    We&#x27;re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are 
providing services back to the grid when they don&#x27;t need to consume energy or have backup power.
    This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r2">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
    Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation 
process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>
<span class="r5">the same time as vehicle production?</span>
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span class="r2">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question, which is question number two from retail shareholders.
    Does Tesla&#x27;s tablet cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates?
    Does it improve the required taper curve?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium plating on the anode.
    And while the tablet&#x27;s architecture helps avoid overheating because it&#x27;s a more power dense architecture at high 
continuous charge rates, it doesn&#x27;t change the anode plating story.
    Electro design and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how to avoid that 
lithium plating problem.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">564</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    They&#x27;ve done an incredible job, and it&#x27;s an honor to work with such a great team.
    I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done, and just what a great group to 
work with, like I said, it&#x27;s just an honor to work with such a great team.
    And as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter, and although the automotive 
industry was down about <span class="r2">30</span>% year-over-year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first 
half of the year.
    So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.
    We&#x27;re also very excited to announce that we&#x27;re going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
    It&#x27;s going to be right near Austin.
    It will be about -- I&#x27;ll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be a lot of questions.
    But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and <span class="r2">15</span> minutes from Downtown Austin, and it&#x27;s 
about <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> acres, and we&#x27;re going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning.
    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.</span>
    And we&#x27;ll be doing Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the eastern half of North America.
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.
    Let&#x27;s see, is there anything more I want to say about?
    There&#x27;s a lot of information.
    So anything, guys?
    All right.
    Well, I&#x27;m sure they have lots of questions.
    We&#x27;ve already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
    So it&#x27;s already underway, started this weekend.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">659</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting 
of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&amp;A within operating expenses.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $<span class="r2">8.6</span> billion, which included free cash flows 
of over $<span class="r2">400</span> million.
    This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as 
well as movements in working capital.
    A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
    While our AR balance is usually about <span class="r2">20</span>% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
    First, overall, less than <span class="r2">30</span>% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
    Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain 
methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted 
significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
    Third, roughly <span class="r2">40</span>% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV 
incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span class="r2">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5"> million units </span>
<span class="r5">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span class="r5">beyond Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
    So it&#x27;s a long way to go with those.
    I think we&#x27;ll do the obvious things.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla?
    What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
    Elon Musk

Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
    I think the upgrading of the fleet to full-self driving, especially with an over-the-air software update.
    I mean, we go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change.

Thanks so much, guys.
    Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you&#x27;re seeing that play out?
    Obviously, it&#x27;s a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are really in the way here, but we&#x27;d love to 
understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the rollout of FSD throughout the balance of
this year and into next year?
