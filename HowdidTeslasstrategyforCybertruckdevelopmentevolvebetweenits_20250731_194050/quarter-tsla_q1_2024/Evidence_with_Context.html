start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span class="r2">10</span>%.
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span class="r2">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient 
manner.
    The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and 
ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
    In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely 
rewarding.
    Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
    And we can open it up to Q&amp;A.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s start with investor Q&amp;A.
    The first question is, what is the status of <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    What is the current output?
    Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> production increased about <span class="r2">18</span>% to <span class="r2">20</span>% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about <span class="r2">7</span> 
gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four </span>
<span class="r5">lines in Phase </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5">, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we&#x27;re ahead of the ramp.</span>
    Because we&#x27;re ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the 
lines and production volume increases.
    So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is on Optimus.
    So what is the current status of Optimus?
    Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
    When do you expect to start mass production?
    Elon Musk

We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab.
    In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful 
tasks before the end of this year.
    And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year.
    These are just guesses.
    As I&#x27;ve said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.
    Because if you&#x27;ve got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is 
no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.
    So that&#x27;s what is going to happen.
    And I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with 
efficient inference on the robot itself.

    Lars Moravy

I think we – Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks.
    But as you mentioned, we’re updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low-cost vehicles in 
a more CapEx efficient way.
    That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible.
    These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our 
capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We’ll talk about this more on August <span class="r2">8</span>.
    But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that
autonomy for a gigantic fleet.
    And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do 
unsupervised full self-driving.
    Lars Moravy

<span class="r2">5</span> million cars?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

A little less?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It will be <span class="r2">7</span> million cars in a year or so and then <span class="r2">10</span> million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of 
millions of cars.
    Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?</span>
    Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
    The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.
    So we’ll have to wait till August.
    The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
    We already talked about that.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span class="r2">10</span>%.
