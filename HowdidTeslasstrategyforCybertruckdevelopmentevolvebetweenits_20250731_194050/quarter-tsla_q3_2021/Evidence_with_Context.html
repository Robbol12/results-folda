I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
    If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD 
compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

Can you hear me, guys?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Amazing.
    I&#x27;m very impressed that you managed to figure that out.
    Martin Viecha

We have to.

Thank you, Pierre.
