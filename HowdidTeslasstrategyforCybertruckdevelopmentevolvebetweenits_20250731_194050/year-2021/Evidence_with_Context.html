    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around that based upon the regulatory processes, but that&#x27;s our goal.

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin
and Austin?
    And timing for new factory announcements?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we want to comment on -- like that&#x27;s -- it&#x27;s always possible to increase the output of any given factory, 
to say, what&#x27;s the next capacity?
    Well, it&#x27;s difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity 
quite a lot.
    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span class="r2">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r5">And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?</span>
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.

the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">76</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    Then, we are trying to get <span class="r7">[</span>Audio Gap<span class="r7">]</span> in the cars slowly for the past few months.
    But we are just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we have built.
    But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.
    So -- and then to be in sort of fairly high-volume production for the S in Q3 and to start delivering the Model X in
Q3 as well.
    So I think as we ramp up, I think, probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high.
    So surely, it’s going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes.
    So probably, we are -- like we are going to aim to produce over <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> S/X per week, perhaps, if we get lucky, 
upwards of <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">400</span> or <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">500</span>.
    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
    And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other </span>
<span class="r5">products.</span>
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Thanks, Elon.
    So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of <span class="r2">2021</span>, as Elon had 
mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
    First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the 
first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span class="r2">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1658</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I&#x27;m not going to go through every sort of thing that we&#x27;re working on because I think a lot of them deserve product 
launches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call.
    So, I&#x27;ll talk kind of at a high level -- yes, mostly at a high level.
    The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.
    So, both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
    This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
    So, last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, 
changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
    And that was not the only supply chain issue.
    So there&#x27;s just hundreds of things.
    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span class="r2">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
    But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same 
because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
    So, if we&#x27;d actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on
that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
    And the same is true of this year.
    So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
    It would not make any sense because we&#x27;ll still be part constrained.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, </span>
<span class="r5">Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.</span>
    That is most likely.
    But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
    So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we&#x27;re doing this year 
is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
    This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
    If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
    Capital equipment is distilled labor.
    So, what happens if you don&#x27;t actually have a labor shortage?
    I&#x27;m not sure what an economy even means at that point.
    That&#x27;s what Optimus is about.
    So, very important.
    Drew, you want to talk about the <span class="r2">4680</span> program, or is this a good, right time?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
    Sure.
    So throughout <span class="r2">2021</span>, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house <span class="r2">4680</span> effort to provide us flexibility 
and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
    As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that 
you mentioned, Elon, in <span class="r2">2022</span> or to say differently, <span class="r2">4680</span> cells are not a constraint to our <span class="r2">2022</span> volume plans, based on 
the information we have.

    We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
    We&#x27;ll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
    If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD 
compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.
