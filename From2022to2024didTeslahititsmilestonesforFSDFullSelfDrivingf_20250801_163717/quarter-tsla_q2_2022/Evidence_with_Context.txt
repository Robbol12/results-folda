[TSLA_Q2_2022] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #452] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO [ph], and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
     But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
     And so that’s why I am confident we will get to 5,000 cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year or early next year and probably but not certainly, 10,000 cars a week at both locations by the end of next year.

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin, go ahead please.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
>>> Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality rolling out and the increased cycle times, how you see that evolving through the balance of this year and into 2023?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
     I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the caveats associated with that can use it.
     Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
     The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
     It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
     Colin Rusch

Great.
