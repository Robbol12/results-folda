[TSLA_Q3_2022] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #34] [PILOT]
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
     So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
>>> So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.
     We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.

2. [Sentence #28] [PILOT]
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
     We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
     And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
     We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
