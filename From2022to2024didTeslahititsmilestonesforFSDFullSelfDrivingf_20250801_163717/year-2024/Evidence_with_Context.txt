[Year 2024] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #211, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
>>> The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
     Elon already talked about that.
     So we’ll have to wait till August.
     The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
     We already talked about that.

2. [Sentence #806, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you.
     Just a couple more.
>>> Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
-----
3. [Sentence #693, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
     So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
     So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
     We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
     The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
     I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
>>> Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
     And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
     ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
     And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
     I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.

4. [Sentence #1972, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     So, it's really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
     But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car -- allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were little concerned.
     But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
     And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
>>> What we're seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla full self-driving technology.
     What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
     And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer.
     That's better than us selling CAD drawings.
     And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it's not worth the complexity.
     And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
     I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.

5. [Sentence #814, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
>>> It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.
     With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
     But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
     And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thanks very much.
     And now we will move on to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.

6. [Sentence #1892, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as much demand as we can possibly make.
     So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation, and we're building a third factory.
     So, we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
     Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from 1 pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications?
     It can't go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
     But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time.
     So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
>>> And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y.
     In fact, I think it probably will be viewed '25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.
     There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
     I don't even know who's in second place.
     Like you say, like, who's in the second place for real-world AI?
     I would need a very big telescope to see them.
     That's how far behind they are.
     All right.
-----
7. [Sentence #665, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
     We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
     But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
     The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
     In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
     So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
     This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.
>>> Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works.
     Version 12.5 has 5x the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.
     So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
     So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks.
     I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
     One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block.
     Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
     So it's very compelling.

8. [Sentence #365, TSLA_Q1_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
     Mark please go ahead and unmute.
     Mark Delaney

Yes.
     Good afternoon.
     Thanks very much for taking the question.
     The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not really been believing in it.
     Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
>>> And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.
     And I think it is.
     I think we've now with 12.3, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving.
     No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
     Vaibhav Taneja

No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.

9. [Sentence #1200, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.
     And we're also -- so that's 12.5.
     Version 13 of FSD is going out soon.
     will elaborate more on that later in the call.
     We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5.
     And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three orders of magnitude.
     So, that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
>>> So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it's next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year.
     Ashok, do you want to say anything?
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
     Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 100x improvement with 12.5 from starting of this year and then with v13 release.
     We expect to be 1,000x from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
     And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
     And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
     By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.
-----
10. [Sentence #573, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it.
     We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every carmaker on earth.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
     Ben, go ahead and unmute.
     Ben, you're still muted.
>>> Elon Musk

Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FSD 12.3.
     It really – you can't – it's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     So since Ben is not unmuting.
     Let's try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research.
     Final question.
     Shreyas Patil

Thanks so much.
     Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS.
