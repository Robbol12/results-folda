I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.

    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the high volume version of Optimus 
will also be produced here in Texas.

    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.

    So, it&#x27;s really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
    But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car --
allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to
intervene or were little concerned.
    But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
    And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">full self-driving technology.</span>
    What we&#x27;ve generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
    And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference 
computer.
    That&#x27;s better than us selling CAD drawings.
    And then we&#x27;re only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the 
complexity.
    And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we 
obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
    I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that 
unless you have FSD, you&#x27;re dead.

    With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
    But I&#x27;m certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
    And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla&#x27;s software, yes.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thanks very much.
    And now we will move on to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when we look back on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> or Model Y.</span>
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.

    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
    This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- 
not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we&#x27;ve made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version</span>

    So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
    So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>, we are finally merged the two stacks.
    I still find that most people actually don&#x27;t know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand
the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
    One of the things we&#x27;re going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car 
is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them
around the block.
    Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
    So it&#x27;s very compelling.

Yes.
    Good afternoon.
    Thanks very much for taking the question.
    The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not 
really been believing in it.
    Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.
    And I think it is.
    I think we&#x27;ve now with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.3</span>, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a 
relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving.
    No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
    Vaibhav Taneja

No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.

    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span> of FSD is going out soon.
    will elaborate more on that later in the call.
    We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>.
    And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three 
orders of magnitude.
    So, that&#x27;s a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it&#x27;s next -- it </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">seems extremely likely to be next year.</span>
    Ashok, do you want to say anything?
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
    Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 10<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> improvement with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> from 
starting of this year and then with v13 release.
    We expect to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,00<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
    And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also 
helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

Okay.
    Thank you.
    And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
    Ben, go ahead and unmute.
    Ben, you&#x27;re still muted.

    It really – you can&#x27;t – it&#x27;s impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.

All right.
    So since Ben is not unmuting.

Thanks so much.
    Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would 
decline by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> of COGS.
