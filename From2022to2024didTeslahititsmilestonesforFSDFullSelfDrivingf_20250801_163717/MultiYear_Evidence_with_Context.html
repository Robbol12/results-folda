    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Thanks.
    Second question, obviously, the higher profitability that you guys have been able to experience over the last couple
of quarters, a lot of that is reflecting sort of <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&quot;real&quot;</span> improvement.
    Another part of it is because we’re no longer paying you, Elon, as much as we were.
    And so I’m wondering the extent to which you and the Board are in the process of contemplating another one of these 
long-term compensation packages, which in the past have seemed to work quite well.
    Thanks.

Great.

Perfect.
    Just to follow-up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, but obviously, it seems pretty

Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s First Quarter <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Q&amp;A Webcast.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">of other executives.</span>
    Our Q1 results were announced at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this 
webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.
    Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Zach will have some opening remarks.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">211</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    So, this is something we think about quite a lot.
    It depends what extreme size means.
    But certainly looking at, like, say, the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> million, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> million, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million 
vehicle levels, you really have to analyze the sort of macroeconomic, just like what is the tonnage of lithium that you 
need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes.
    It looks like really you think of like just macro tonnage.
    And when we need to think about this for the world as a whole, because just -- we want to -- what are limiting 
factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future.
    And whatever the most limiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors.
    So, right now, we think mining and refining lithium is -- appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is 
responsible for quite a bit of cost growth in the sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s I think the single biggest cost growth item right now certainly on a percentage basis.</span>
    Although just for those who don’t totally know this, the actual content of lithium in lithium ion cell is maybe 
around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>% of the cell, so.
    Andrew Baglino

<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> kgs a car.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> kg.
    It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the 
cathode.
    So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
    So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total 
amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">167</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
    Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt architecture probably, but it 
really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for the cost of changing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts.
    And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
    Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
    Elon Musk

$<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrew Baglino</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Sorry.</span>
    $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    It’s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe
it’s been whittled away to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> or less.
    On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to
the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more 
semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage.
    And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck.
    But for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y platform where we’ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It’s basically zero for robotaxi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">34</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.</span>
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
    This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.
    Second, as I’ve mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps.
    And thus, those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.
    Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds.
    We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year and believe our 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">54</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
    So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in vehicle production in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> versus ‘<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span>.
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.</span>
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
    Basically, our estimate is that going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts might save $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    It’s not really moving the needle.
    Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
    It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">110</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">-volt household power -- or voltage.</span>
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.

    Like I said, it’s long-term, like years now, it makes sense probably to an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt architecture probably, but it

[Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">235</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And so, we’re really concerned about raw materials, not just like mining them and consuming them, but when we get 
them in the door, using all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% of them.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    No, that’s a great point.
    So, we’re storing -- we’re installing sort of furnaces  for probably for aluminum like sort for the Model Y that 
we’ve built here in Giga Texas has both a front and a rear body casting.
    So, we’re casting almost two-thirds of the body.
    It’s high pressure die cast aluminum.
    And so, we can take both, scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out and put that -- just really 
pass that back into the melting -- aluminum melting pot.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then, as Elon was saying, also take any stampings and any other aluminum scrap and also through that in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">melting pot, matter of fact, we’ve also figured out that we can use wheels from practically any car.</span>
    Yes, yes.
    So, we’re going to be recycling the casting aluminum wheels from legacy gasoline cars as well and throwing that in 
the melting pot for our aluminum cast body of Model Y.
    And also we’ll be moving to the sort of cast part rear body in all vehicles over time?
    Well, actually, maybe not S/X, but <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>/Y.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    At what rate do you expect Berlin and Austin to ramp relative to Shanghai?
    Are you able to leverage learnings from Shanghai, or are the processes substantially different in the new factories?

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.

    Lars Moravy

Yes.

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it
takes all the long-term impact.

    On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to
the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more

    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked </span>

    It’s not -- it’s called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviest item in the cell is the 
cathode.
    So, that’s the nickel or the iron phosphate.
    So we’re looking carefully at all of the raw materials and trying to figure out how we can accelerate the total 
amount of raw materials needed to transition the world to sustainability.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think we’ve got -- we don’t have enough time on this call to really go through all those details, but we are </span>

    And we think we’ll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    One thing I want to call out is like we’re also committed to recycling at all of our cell factories.
    We’re recycling <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> tons a week right now in Reno and ramping to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> with all of that reclaimed material going 
directly back into our cathode supply chain.
    So, we’re looking at the beginning and end of life needs here.
    Elon Musk

And that’s true like since Reno, we built a Gigafactory and we started doing that with batteries.
    But as we build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we said was all of 
its non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the casting shop.

    On the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span>-volt thing, yes, so it’s really a case-by-case thing.
    For the smaller platform vehicles like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y, there’s some wins and losses with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts, not everything is 
better.
    And so, we look at that platform, and we’re not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage, but 
there’s nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.
    It’s really about mass and power.
    And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Let me just quantify that.
    Basically, our estimate is that going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">800</span> volts might save $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not really moving the needle.</span>
    Andrew Baglino

And you’re changing many things.
    It’s charging infrastructure all the way through the entire vehicle system to get maybe $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I mean, in the U.S., you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">110</span>-volt household power -- or voltage.
    And then, in your most -- like sort of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">220</span>.
    But really, it doesn’t make that much of a difference, and appliances work pretty much as well in, say, Europe as 
they do in the U.S.
    So, there’s some -- the advantages are small and the cost is high.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well.
    Inflation, raw material prices, expedite and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure.
    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components </span>

    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
    As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">16</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    My second question is it’s impressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle -- cost of goods sold per 
vehicle, given what we’ve seen in terms of commodities actually.
    And from here, you have a lot of savings opportunities with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and the cell manufacturing changes, the anode
chemistry, structural packs, giga castings.
    Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you’re seeing and that you’re 
going to need additional pricing as well in addition to those specific initiatives that you’ve called out?
    Elon Musk

We hope we don’t need to increase the pricing further.
    The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs.
    And if those growth -- if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actually may slightly reduce prices.
    So, should we currently anticipate making significant price increases.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But obviously, we don’t control the macroeconomic environment.</span>
    If governments keep printing vast amounts of money and if there’s -- if there are not significant increases in 
lithium extraction and refinement and other raw materials, such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw 
materials, then obviously, that will drive prices to high levels.
    So, if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like, we’ll adjust accordingly.
    But, the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> 
months from now.
    So, this is our best guess.
    Andrew Baglino

But I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
    So, we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as 
quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.
    Elon Musk

Yes.

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just a Q1 recap.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.</span>
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.

    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.</span>
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
    And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.

    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
