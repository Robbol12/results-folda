[Year 2023] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

     I mean, like we’re asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer.
     So, let’s move on.
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today.
     So, we’ll speak to you all in the next three months.
     Thank you very much.

Elon Musk

[Call Starts Abruptly]…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
>>> Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
     We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s.
     We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
     We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12.
     This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
     Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
     Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
     Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
     So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
     Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
>>> Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?
     And if so, when?
     Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
     We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
     Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
     It must have a lead car in plains, only 40 miles per hour.
     Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
     But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.

3. [Sentence #1001, TSLA_Q2_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today.
     Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week.
     If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish.
     If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
     Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
     The value is just tremendous.
     So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
>>> I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next analyst.
     The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
     First, following up on the autonomy.
     So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD incrementally.
     What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates?

>>> And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?
     Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
     The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
     So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
     And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
     But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves.
     Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
     That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

     Some other highlights.
     Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations.
     As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the North American Charging Standard.
     We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network.
     We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general.
     So, that’s the goal there.
     Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies.
>>> And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
     So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
     We’re more than happy to license it to others.
     And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
     Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to come.
     Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
     And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
