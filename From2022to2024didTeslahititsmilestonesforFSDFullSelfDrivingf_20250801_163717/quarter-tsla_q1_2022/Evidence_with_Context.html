Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over </span>

    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
    And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
