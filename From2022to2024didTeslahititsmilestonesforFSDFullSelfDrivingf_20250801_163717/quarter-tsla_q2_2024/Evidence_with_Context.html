    And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the high volume version of Optimus 
will also be produced here in Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you.
    Just a couple more.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.</span>
    With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
    But I&#x27;m certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
    And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla&#x27;s software, yes.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thanks very much.
    And now we will move on to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
    This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- 
not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we&#x27;ve made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">self-driving works.</span>
    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> has 5x the parameters of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.4</span> and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.
    So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
    So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>, we are finally merged the two stacks.
    I still find that most people actually don&#x27;t know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand
the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
    One of the things we&#x27;re going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car 
is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them
around the block.
    Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
    So it&#x27;s very compelling.
