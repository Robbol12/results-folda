[Year 2019] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in **Europe**, similar to what ****North** **America**** experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to **China**.
2. [Sentence #25]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our ****global** **deliveries**** occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
3. [Sentence #40]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) And keep in mind, **global** expansion for the ****Model** 3** has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the **Model** S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
4. [Sentence #62]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) The **global** expansion of ****Model** 3** was a huge theme within the quarter.
5. [Sentence #75]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) This led to a binary inflow of ****Model** 3** cars to EMEA and **China** and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
6. [Sentence #91]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that **North** American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of ****Model** 3**.
7. [Sentence #181]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) The standard range plus ****Model** 3** with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and **Europe**.
8. [Sentence #225]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and **Europe** and in the second half almost exclusively for ****North** **America****.
9. [Sentence #290]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for ****North** **America**** **Model** 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments?
10. [Sentence #297]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and **China** as well, but what we’re seeing in ****North** **America**** is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].
11. [Sentence #301]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) But on ****Model** 3**, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 **deliveries**, whatever that assumption is for ****Model** 3**, does your current order flow support that?
12. [Sentence #345]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) Is that basically saying that people in **Europe** and **China** are just going to need to wait longer to take their **deliveries** and you’re going to try to emphasize more in ****North** **America**** in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
13. [Sentence #346]  (TSLA_Q1_2019) It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to **China**, **Europe** cars, and the second half is dedicated to **North** American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
14. [Sentence #585]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in ****North** **America**** by simplifying our solar offering into three sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.
15. [Sentence #659]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the ****Model** 3** production -- fixing the ****Model** 3** production **ramp** and simplifying the design of the ****Model** 3**.
16. [Sentence #661]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) Now that we feel that ****Model** 3** production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage.
17. [Sentence #737]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) Elon Musk

Yeah, we're in trial production of ****Model** 3**, basically sending cars through the system, and we're ramping rapidly.
18. [Sentence #804]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the ****Model** 3** sold in **China** for **China** could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
19. [Sentence #910]  (TSLA_Q3_2019) It looks like the **deliveries** have stayed to the **deliveries** of the previous quarter and that ****Model** 3** has indeed cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.
20. [Sentence #1046]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching ****Model** 3** last quarter and achieving the first **deliveries** earlier this year.
21. [Sentence #1088]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This year for the Shanghai built ****Model** 3**, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
22. [Sentence #1091]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built ****Model** 3** and remain focused on continuing the production **ramp** and managing costs.
23. [Sentence #1099]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the **ramp** of Shanghai built ****Model** 3** due to a government required factory shutdown.
24. [Sentence #1110]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in ****North** **America**** on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
25. [Sentence #1187]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of ****Model** 3** in **China** relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
26. [Sentence #1191]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in **China**, ****North** **America**** and **Europe**.
27. [Sentence #1192]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in **China**, a factory in California, a factory -- ****North** **America**** factory in **Europe**.
28. [Sentence #1293]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure ****Model** 3** or **Model** Y cars.
29. [Sentence #1326]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, ****Model** 3** is expanding as **Model** Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
30. [Sentence #1376]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So I mean, relative to the current ****Model** 3**, **China** **Model** 2 pricing is slightly lower.
