Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...</span>

<span class="r4">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.</span>
    It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated 
to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for 
customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.

    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America </span>
<span class="r4">experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.</span>
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
    This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global 
deliveries occurring in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.

    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars <span class="r2">3</span> 
and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, </span>
<span class="r4">a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.</span>
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
    Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And also on working capital.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    Martin Viecha

According you see OpEx here to, but it&#x27;s not <span class="r2">2010</span>.
    Okay.
    The next question from institutional investors is given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now
and substantially accelerate the growth in production i.e.

And also, not only <span class="r2">3.5</span>% of our trade-ins for Model <span class="r2">3</span> are coming from Model S. So, it’s from all the Model <span class="r2">3</span> trade-ins, 
Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
    Elon Musk

Yes, for sure.
    People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.

Martin Viecha

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
    Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
    A couple of questions.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; One, you mentioned a $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is </span>
<span class="r4">that a number like since the February </span><span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4"> price adjustments?</span>
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
    And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over <span class="r2">50</span>% 
of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.

    Okay.

    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
    They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model <span class="r2">3</span> more than they ever wanted a 
vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally </span>
<span class="r4">than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the </span>
<span class="r4">Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.</span>
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.

    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This led to a binary inflow of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.</span>
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
    We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.

    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
    Deliveries reached over <span class="r2">112</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles in a single quarter.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $<span class="r2">20</span> billion in 
revenue with zero advertising spend.
    I think that&#x27;s like where we do say that from time-time and I think it&#x27;s often overlooked, but to have the highest 
demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of 
the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of 
advertising.
    At our Fremont factory we&#x27;re producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 
<span class="r2">2006</span> and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
    This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there&#x27;s lot of 
potential to go beyond that number.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the Shanghai factory I&#x27;d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> last </span>
<span class="r4">quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.</span>
    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span class="r2">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span class="r2">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span class="r2">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.

    We cannot hear you.
    Martin Viecha

It&#x27;s very quiet, so we can&#x27;t hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me now?
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s muffled, but we&#x27;ll try.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Sorry for that.
    So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> has indeed </span>
<span class="r4">cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.</span>
    So how are you thinking about these two models going forward?
    What&#x27;s the strategy you have in mind?
    And I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.

Elon Musk

The Model S and X are really niche -- they&#x27;re really niche products.
    I mean, they&#x27;re very expensive, made in low volume.
    To be totally frank, we&#x27;re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else.
    They&#x27;re really of minor importance to the future.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">10</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">91</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    There is an additional $<span class="r2">67</span> million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
    One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February <span class="r2">28</span> as well as the makeshift towards the standard range 
lineup which we launched.
    We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and
scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4">, </span>
<span class="r4">with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, 
the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
    As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
    From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
    So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
    As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity <span class="r2">50</span>% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. and 
then <span class="r2">50</span>% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
    For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
    Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which 
I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; At this point, we&#x27;re expecting a </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4"> to </span><span class="r4">1.5</span><span class="r4"> week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> due to a government </span>
<span class="r4">required factory shutdown.</span>
    This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
Shanghai remains in the early stages.
    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1187</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in</span>
<span class="r4">China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that </span>
<span class="r4">we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.</span>
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars <span class="r2">3</span> 
and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
    So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, 
a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
    Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.

    Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I&#x27;ll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable 
whether that&#x27;s considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue
associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that 
because we know there&#x27;s been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
    And foreign exchange is just something that since we don&#x27;t hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every 
quarter.
    So we&#x27;ll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
    This is George Dailey on for Adam.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> sold in</span>
<span class="r4">China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont </span>
<span class="r4">right now?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it&#x27;s a good question.
    At least based on the plans that we have now, we&#x27;re expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is coming 
out of our Fremont factory.
    There&#x27;s still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and 
we need to work those costs down.
    And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the 
product offering.
    So I think just for now, it&#x27;s safe to assume that it&#x27;s roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of 
the Fremont facility.
    George Dailey

Great.
    And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it&#x27;s been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many 
OEMs seem that they don&#x27;t have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don&#x27;t even offer 
one right now.

    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent 
quarters.
    As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    This year for the Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
    In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the 
region.
    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and remain focused on continuing the production </span>
<span class="r4">ramp and managing costs.</span>
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
    For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
    Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which 
I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And I think also our Director of Energy Operations Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
    Kunal Girotra

Hi, everyone.
    My name is Kanal Girotra, and I&#x27;ve been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying 
our energy products.
    I now run Tesla Energy&#x27;s deployment and fulfillment teams.
    Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage 
businesses.
    As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost <span class="r2">50</span>% over last quarter, and our energy 
storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by <span class="r2">15</span>% to an all-time high of <span class="r2">477</span> megawatt hours.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into three </span>
<span class="r4">sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.</span>
    Elon Musk

Actually, if I may interject.
    What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is, in California and in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar 
subscription or solar rental, there&#x27;s no money down, and you instantly save on your utility bill, and there&#x27;s no 
long-term contract.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Right.
    Elon Musk

So, it&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.
    It&#x27;s really, do you want something that prints money?
    And if it doesn&#x27;t print money, we&#x27;ll fix it or take it back.
    It&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">16</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">661</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla&#x27;s automotive sector or 
business.
    This is the most underappreciated group.
    I think it could be bigger, but it&#x27;s certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.
    Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.
    And part of it is like, for about <span class="r2">18</span> months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources.
    We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production -- 
fixing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even 
took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we 
didn&#x27;t have enough cells.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that we feel that Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we&#x27;ve restored resources to</span>
<span class="r4">Tesla Solar and storage.</span>
    And so that&#x27;s going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.
    And but we had to do it because if we didn&#x27;t solve Model <span class="r2">3</span>, Tesla wouldn&#x27;t survive.
    So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.
    But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part
of Tesla&#x27;s activity in the future.
    And Tesla&#x27;s mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means 
sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
    And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much 
sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products.
    And I think you&#x27;ll see that we&#x27;re producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are 
consumed in the car -- in our cars.

    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The global expansion of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> was a huge theme within the quarter.</span>
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
    Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their 
deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to<span class="r7">...</span>

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated </span>
<span class="r4">to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for </span>
<span class="r4">customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.</span>
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
    So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">19</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1088</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We&#x27;ve also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and
the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
    Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $<span class="r2">82</span> million driven almost entirely by an expense 
related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
    This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied 
to.
    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent 
quarters.
    As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This year for the Shanghai built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.</span>
    In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the 
region.
    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
    We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model <span class="r2">3</span> and remain focused on continuing the production 
ramp and managing costs.
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension
and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
    So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and
then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
    It’s already increasing.
    Pierre Ferragu

And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am
surprised you don’t – you just still expect a loss.
    So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a 
profit for similar volumes?
    How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much 
is related to pricing and other things?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of </span>
<span class="r4">the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.</span>
    And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it’s West Coast or East Coast, then we could 
deliver more cars.
    But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but 
really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just – not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive 
efforts from Tesla team.
    So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind
this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
    And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
    Two other things that I would add.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">21</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
    Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America 
experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries occurring in the final </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> days of Q1.</span>
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.

    The next question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo-taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, 
when you look over the next three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don&#x27;t 
understand or have missed?
    Elon Musk

I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking 
about.
    In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla&#x27;s automotive sector or 
business.
    This is the most underappreciated group.

Okay.
    The second question, we&#x27;ve already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
    So we&#x27;ll jump to the third question from Craig.
    News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.
    Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga <span class="r2">3</span>?
    And confirm purpose of the second building now being built.
    Is that for battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">Yeah, we&#x27;re in trial production of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, basically sending cars through the system, and we&#x27;re ramping rapidly.</span>
    We&#x27;re expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
    The second building is indeed for battery and module production.
    And there&#x27;s probably -- there&#x27;s obviously a bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously 
we need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla car insurance?
    Is there a timeline to expand it nationally and internationally?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I can take that.

    One, you mentioned a $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is 
that a number like since the February <span class="r2">28</span> price adjustments?
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% </span>
<span class="r4">of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .</span>
    Dan Galves

That’s really helpful.
    And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
    So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
    But on Model <span class="r2">3</span>, whatever your assumption is within the <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is 
for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, does your current order flow support that?
    Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
    Elon Musk

I think we’ll I think we’ll be fine.
    Yes, I don’t think there any major thing required.

Hi, good evening, everybody.
    So in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve, obviously you 
have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price.
    So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like steadily in <span class="r2">2020</span>?
    Elon Musk

Making the price better and better, so is the value.
    I know we&#x27;re wondering we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand looks like, I 
mean like right now it&#x27;s pretty good, maybe they will change who knows, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

But I think the way you described, it is fair.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I mean, relative to the current Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, China Model </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> pricing is slightly lower.</span>
    And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
    So you can see that it&#x27;s clearly slightly higher than what Model <span class="r2">3</span> is out of Fremont.
    How the mix of those three products and that&#x27;s out over the course of the year, we&#x27;ll see.
    I think it&#x27;s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP, when you 
average them together.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean the affordability of our car and trying to improve radically because for a very -- to tariffs mostly going 
to weigh, purchase tax exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the 
ocean.
    So the affordability is nine day for our car intent.

    So that&#x27;s and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
    So, I think we&#x27;re just going to have go as best we can with Model Y and make sure it&#x27;s a great product.
    I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- does on our October analyst call.
    And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of
the things they see.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it&#x27;s important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next <span class="r2">18</span> to <span class="r2">24</span> months.
    But what we&#x27;re working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have <span class="r2">3</span> and Y locally produced in all 
location.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">And so, Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of</span>
<span class="r4">having these products on the major continents.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Also the rule of thumb of <span class="r2">10</span>%, I think you need to see it when you see the car, you realize that it&#x27;s not just a <span class="r2">10</span>% 
different car.
    It&#x27;s not just that -- there is more change happening like to the customers&#x27; perspective as well.

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it </span>
<span class="r4">does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating </span>
<span class="r4">production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> or Model Y cars.</span>
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.

sheet.

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r2">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not</span>
<span class="r4">just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in </span>
<span class="r4">North America on the order of </span><span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4"> million new roofs per year.</span>
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.

    Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
    Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
    Your guidance for <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere 
between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
    Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or
reservation list maybe telling you?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The standard range plus Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> with autopilot included at $</span><span class="r4">39</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">500</span><span class="r4"> is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and </span>
<span class="r4">affordable to probably something on the order like the top </span><span class="r4">40</span><span class="r4">% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.</span>
    So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that.
    We are.
    And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X 
upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade.
    So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant.
    And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we 
are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December <span class="r2">31</span>.
    So, these were all very positive factors.
    We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
