[TSLA_Q4_2020] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #28] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
     So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020.
     So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
     So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.
     We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
     Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
     We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
>>> We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
     We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
     We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
     This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
     We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
     We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
     And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
     And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.

     Jerome?
     Jerome Guillen

Yes.
     Well, as far as best service, no service.
     So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
     In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
>>> One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
     We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
     In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
     So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
     And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
     We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
     For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.

3. [Sentence #350] [PLAN]
     So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space.
     We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
     And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
     Obviously, there's a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
     Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you're migrating some of your exposure around some of your raw material costs?
     Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
>>> Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and North America.
     But we're also looking forward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components.
     We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you're going to have enough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate sharing of the risk.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
     Thank you.

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can jump straight into questions from [Safe] [ph] Technologies.
     The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
     And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
     So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
>>> It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
     But now we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
     So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing.
     And so that's something that we've accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become the leader in the space.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof.

     Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
     What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
>>> It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
     So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.

     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.

     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
     We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
     In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
     So that's what we're doing to improve service.
     In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
     Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.

     Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter.
     All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry leading.
     As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet, as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology.
     The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches.
     That's a few things we should keep in mind.
     We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021.
     As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
>>> Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
     Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
     We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
     Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
     I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.

     Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
     And we are trying to move away from the phone.
     As the app is much better than the phone.
     It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.
     And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.

     So we've been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
     And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
     The Model S Plaid, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month.

     I love these great projects halfway or part like hallway done.
     So I do expect to be running the company for several years into the future.
     Now, obviously, nobody is or should be CEO forever.
     So I don't expect to be -- like the sheer amount of work required to be CEO of Tesla is insane.
     And I do -- I think I do probably more -- I definitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO.
     So it would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep seven days a week, pretty intense.
     So -- but I think the mission isn't over yet, and we still got a long way ago before we can really make a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.
>>> I mean, the goal Tesla, from beginning, has been to accelerate sustainable energy.
     And -- but if you say like what percentage of cars on the road are electric today, it's still very, very tiny, like an order of 1%, or less than 1% of the total fleet worldwide.
     So that's the full have long way to go for on the order of 1% of the fleet is electric.
     There's also a tremendous way to go on solar power, although it's exciting to see the advent of very cost-competitive wind and solar and geothermal.
     And of course, we need a large volume of stationary battery packs.
     I mean basically, maybe the three legs of a sustainable energy future are sustainable energy generation, led by solar, wind, geothermal and hydro and a few others.
     And I'm actually not against nuclear fission.
     I actually think nuclear fission is – with a well-designed reactor in a situation that is not subject to bad weather or seriously bad weather is actually is a good thing to do.
