America, Europe, and China?

    We cannot hear you.
    Martin Viecha

It&#x27;s very quiet, so we can&#x27;t hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me now?
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s muffled, but we&#x27;ll try.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Sorry for that.
    So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> has indeed </span>
<span class="r5">cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.</span>
    So how are you thinking about these two models going forward?
    What&#x27;s the strategy you have in mind?
    And I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.

Elon Musk

The Model S and X are really niche -- they&#x27;re really niche products.
    I mean, they&#x27;re very expensive, made in low volume.
    To be totally frank, we&#x27;re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else.
    They&#x27;re really of minor importance to the future.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.

    Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I&#x27;ll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable 
whether that&#x27;s considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue
associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that 
because we know there&#x27;s been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
    And foreign exchange is just something that since we don&#x27;t hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every 
quarter.
    So we&#x27;ll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
    This is George Dailey on for Adam.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> sold in</span>
<span class="r5">China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont </span>
<span class="r5">right now?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it&#x27;s a good question.
    At least based on the plans that we have now, we&#x27;re expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is coming 
out of our Fremont factory.
    There&#x27;s still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and 
we need to work those costs down.
    And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the 
product offering.
    So I think just for now, it&#x27;s safe to assume that it&#x27;s roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of 
the Fremont facility.
    George Dailey

Great.
    And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it&#x27;s been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many 
OEMs seem that they don&#x27;t have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don&#x27;t even offer 
one right now.

Thank you very much.
    And I think also our Director of Energy Operations Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
    Kunal Girotra

Hi, everyone.
    My name is Kanal Girotra, and I&#x27;ve been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying 
our energy products.
    I now run Tesla Energy&#x27;s deployment and fulfillment teams.
    Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage 
businesses.
    As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost <span class="r2">50</span>% over last quarter, and our energy 
storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by <span class="r2">15</span>% to an all-time high of <span class="r2">477</span> megawatt hours.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into three </span>
<span class="r5">sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.</span>
    Elon Musk

Actually, if I may interject.
    What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is, in California and in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar 
subscription or solar rental, there&#x27;s no money down, and you instantly save on your utility bill, and there&#x27;s no 
long-term contract.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Right.
    Elon Musk

So, it&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.
    It&#x27;s really, do you want something that prints money?
    And if it doesn&#x27;t print money, we&#x27;ll fix it or take it back.
    It&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.

    In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla&#x27;s automotive sector or 
business.
    This is the most underappreciated group.
    I think it could be bigger, but it&#x27;s certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.
    Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.
    And part of it is like, for about <span class="r2">18</span> months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources.
    We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production -- 
fixing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even 
took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we 
didn&#x27;t have enough cells.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that we feel that Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we&#x27;ve restored resources to</span>
<span class="r5">Tesla Solar and storage.</span>
    And so that&#x27;s going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.
    And but we had to do it because if we didn&#x27;t solve Model <span class="r2">3</span>, Tesla wouldn&#x27;t survive.
    So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.
    But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part
of Tesla&#x27;s activity in the future.
    And Tesla&#x27;s mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means 
sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
    And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much 
sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products.
    And I think you&#x27;ll see that we&#x27;re producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are 
consumed in the car -- in our cars.

    The next question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo-taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, 
when you look over the next three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don&#x27;t 
understand or have missed?
    Elon Musk

I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking 
about.
    In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla&#x27;s automotive sector or 
business.

Okay.
    The second question, we&#x27;ve already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
    So we&#x27;ll jump to the third question from Craig.
    News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.
    Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga <span class="r2">3</span>?
    And confirm purpose of the second building now being built.
    Is that for battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">Yeah, we&#x27;re in trial production of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, basically sending cars through the system, and we&#x27;re ramping rapidly.</span>
    We&#x27;re expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
    The second building is indeed for battery and module production.
    And there&#x27;s probably -- there&#x27;s obviously a bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously 
we need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla car insurance?
    Is there a timeline to expand it nationally and internationally?

    It&#x27;s basically about <span class="r2">12</span> people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given
amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
    So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly 
accelerate FSD.
    That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
    Yeah.

    It&#x27;s an art piece basically.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, just to add -- I agree.
    They&#x27;re absolutely phenomenal cars.
    And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, that&#x27;s kind of </span>
<span class="r5">consumed a lot of the attention around the company.</span>
    But now as that has stabilized, we&#x27;re able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter.
    And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in 
Q4.

    And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.
