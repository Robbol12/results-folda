[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #345, TSLA_Q1_2019] [PLAN]
     So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Now let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
     Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
     You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
>>> Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
     It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
     And that this [indiscernible] we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
     We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1.
     That’s insane.
     So, I think we need to unwind that.
     I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
     And then we then they can do their regular jobs.

2. [Sentence #66, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
     Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
     The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter.
     We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
     So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.
     First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
>>> This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors.
     The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1.
     Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
     The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.
     And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
     We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward.
     I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.
     On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
-----
3. [Sentence #33, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
     So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1.
     As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted.
     As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
     The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
     This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
     In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost 60%.
>>> It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago.
     There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.
     And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
     And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
     So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
     Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
     They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3.
     And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.

4. [Sentence #23, TSLA_Q1_2019] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles.
     All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
     We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving.
     We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
     And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
     We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
>>> Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
     As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
     This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
     This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
     So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1.
     As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted.
     As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
     The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.

     Martin Viecha

And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon should current owners that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?
     Elon Musk

I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don’t really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months.
     That’s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware.
     So, just no need to rush to the – get your computer replaced.
     It’s like 2 to 3 months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then.
     One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
>>> For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
     But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
     So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.

And also, not only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S. So, it’s from all the Model 3 trade-ins, Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
     Elon Musk

Yes, for sure.
     People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.

Martin Viecha

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
     Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
     A couple of questions.
>>> One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments?
     Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
     I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
     I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
     And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
     And just under $50,000 ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
     And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].

     So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
     If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
     And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
     So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
     So, they have a longer range.
     The Model S now has a range of 370 miles.
     This would actually be at a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster and they were any headwind as well.

9. [Sentence #75, TSLA_Q1_2019] [PLAN]
     Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
     The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.
     And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
     We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward.

     On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
     This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half.
>>> This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
     We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
     So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
     The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
     So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
     We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
     On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
     $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28.

     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
     Joseph Spak

First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin that you’re targeting.
     Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year?
     And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach here, that’s [indiscernible] so we’re targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner.
>>> The biggest lever there is actually two components.
     One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there’s just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us.
     But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we’re executing on over the course of the year.
     And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we’re seeing an increased take rate on our full Self-Driving offering.
     And there are, revenue associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there.
     And as that option becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more revenue on that.
     So all of these things together within our internal gives us [indiscernible].
     Elon Musk

Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume, we’re driving units of the Model 3 which is extremely efficient magnet motor and product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X.
-----
12. [Sentence #91, TSLA_Q1_2019] [PLAN]
     There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
     Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
     If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
     Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%.
     This is due to two factors.
     One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched.
     We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
>>> In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3.
     In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
     Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28.
     Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
     As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
     From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
     So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
     As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
-----
13. [Sentence #127, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see it as an automotive company.
     Can you speak to the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the company?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     The challenge really is battery cells scarcity.
     As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack.
     Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack.
>>> So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack.
     This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?
     J.B. Straubel

Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a – quite a decent number of Powerwalls.
     And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world.
     The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don’t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers.
     So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number.

>>> Sorry, sorry.
     Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%.
     So this is a very big percentage growth rate.
     It’s much faster than an automotive.
     So over time, we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla’s business over time.
     We also have – we are also finding a significant increase in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally refined the product offering to be something that’s extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install.
     So, to radically streamline process from what has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly next week.
     And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version 3 of the design.

I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don’t really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months.
     That’s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the Version 2 hardware.
     So, just no need to rush to the – get your computer replaced.
     It’s like 2 to 3 months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then.
     One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
     For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
     But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
     So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.

18. [Sentence #324, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     I don’t think raising capital should be substitute for making the company operate more effectively.
     So that in that sense, I think it’s just, it’s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just to make sure we don’t have extraneous expenses and we’re just being frugal with capital.
     If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional operation of the business.
     So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while.
     At this point, I do think there are it is similar to raising capital.
     That’s a but this is sort of probably about the right timing, but yes.
     Toni Sacconaghi

So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term?
>>> And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean growth does eat cash especially in a capital-intensive business.
     If you really do believe you have a first mover advantage, why wouldn’t you want to push it as quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short term.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     First of all, I’ll just say that I don’t think capital has been constrained on our growth thus far and the type of those fund in fact, if there was a final constraint on growth would’ve faced capital before now.
     But I think it is very important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we’re we have the appropriate financial discipline throughout the company and are spending money very efficiently.
     At this point, I think we are doing that.
     There’s more work to do, and Tesla today is far more efficient operating organization than it was a year ago.
     We’ve made dramatic improvements across the board.

19. [Sentence #68, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
     The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter.
     We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
     So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.
     First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
     This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors.
     The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1.
>>> Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
     The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.
     And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
     We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward.
     I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.
     On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
     This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half.
     This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
-----
20. [Sentence #28, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
     We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
     Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
     As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
     This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
     This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
     So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1.
>>> As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted.
     As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
     The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
     This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
     In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost 60%.
     It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago.
     There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.
     And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.

21. [Sentence #80, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
     This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half.
     This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
     We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
     So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
     The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
     So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
>>> We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
     On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
     $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28.
     This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes.
     There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
     Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
     If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
     Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%.

Thanks, Martin.
     On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles.
     All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
     We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving.
     We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
     And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.

>>> And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
     And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
     So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
     Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
     They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3.
     And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
     So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
     If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.

     As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
     And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for capital efficient expansion.
     In energy as well, as we have noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned investments in that.
     So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company and I am looking forward to the discussion.

     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you.
     Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
     Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
     Your guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
     Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or reservation list maybe telling you?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and 3.
>>> The standard range plus Model 3 with autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably something on the order like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.
     So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that.
     We are.
     And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade.
     So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant.
     And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December 31.
     So, these were all very positive factors.
     We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model 3.

     Now let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
     Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
     You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
     Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
>>> It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
     And that this [indiscernible] we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
     We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1.
     That’s insane.
     So, I think we need to unwind that.
     I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
     And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
     So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.

     I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.

29. [Sentence #225, TSLA_Q1_2019] [PLAN]
     That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
     So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
     It’s already increasing.
     Pierre Ferragu

And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am surprised you don’t – you just still expect a loss.
     So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a profit for similar volumes?
     How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and other things?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
>>> So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.
     And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it’s West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars.
     But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just – not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive efforts from Tesla team.
     So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
     And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
     Two other things that I would add.
