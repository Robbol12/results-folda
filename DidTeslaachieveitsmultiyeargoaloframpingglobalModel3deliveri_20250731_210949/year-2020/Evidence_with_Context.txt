[Year 2020] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #66, TSLA_Q1_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
>>> And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.

2. [Sentence #565, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     So we're actually going to have a boardwalk where there'll a hiking and biking trail.
     It's going to basically be an ecological paradise.
     Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
     So not closed and only Tesla.
     So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know.
     This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there.
     And it's also where we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
>>> And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.
     Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
     But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America.
     And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
     So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
     And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.
     And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
     The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down the road.

3. [Sentence #659, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
     Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce driving down this balance.
     As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
     We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital management.
     This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next 1.5 years.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let's go to questions from institutional investors first.
>>> The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck?
     Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y?
     Or region-specific vehicles?
     Or anything else?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what's announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches.
     But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity [indiscernible] vehicle of some kind.
     These are likely things at some point.
     But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
-----
4. [Sentence #135, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty â€“ the guest loyalty.
     So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
     To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
>>> And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
     A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
     We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
>>> This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
     It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
-----
6. [Sentence #1811, TSLA_Q4_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
     So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020.
     So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
     So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.
     We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
     Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
     We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
>>> We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
     We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
     We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
     This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
     We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
     We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
     And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
     And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.

     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
     We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
     Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
     We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.
-----
8. [Sentence #22, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PILOT]
     [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
     Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
>>> After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
     In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
     Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.

9. [Sentence #567, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
     So not closed and only Tesla.
     So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know.
     This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there.
     And it's also where we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
     And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.
     Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
>>> But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America.
     And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
     So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
     And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.
     And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
     The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down the road.
     Let's see, is there anything more I want to say about?
     There's a lot of information.
-----
10. [Sentence #880, TSLA_Q2_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     It will be just awesome.
     Yes.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And thereâ€™s like two general classes of cell.
     There's like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer range.
     Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo.
     So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
>>> What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume production later this year.
     So, we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
     And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
     So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
     We use very little cobalt in our system already and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y.
     No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.

11. [Sentence #2004, TSLA_Q4_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Jerome?
     Jerome Guillen

Yes.
     Well, as far as best service, no service.
     So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
     In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
>>> One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
     We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
     In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
     So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
     And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
     We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
     For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
-----
12. [Sentence #2133, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space.
     We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
     And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
     Obviously, there's a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
     Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you're migrating some of your exposure around some of your raw material costs?
     Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
>>> Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and North America.
     But we're also looking forward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components.
     We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you're going to have enough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate sharing of the risk.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
     Thank you.
-----
13. [Sentence #95, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
     This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
     And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary â€“ by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
>>> Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
     Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
     While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
-----
14. [Sentence #380, TSLA_Q1_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
     And so that helps create some of the margin.
     And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
     But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3 when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
     On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
     The commonality is huge.
     It's very important.
>>> And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well, and so we have experience with that both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
     And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
     So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
     There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
     And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
     Elon Musk

It's good.
     We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
     So it's tax.
-----
15. [Sentence #140, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
     And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
>>> And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.
     And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
     In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?
     Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.

16. [Sentence #100, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.

     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
     More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
     Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
     The Tesla team has done a great job here.
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.
-----
17. [Sentence #633, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
     This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world.
     To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects.
     The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions.
     Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
     On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
     This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the various shutdowns.
>>> Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
     With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
     The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
     Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
     While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
     Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
     In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
-----
18. [Sentence #57, TSLA_Q1_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     We're looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
     For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we're underway casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
     In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
     I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
>>> So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
-----
19. [Sentence #1262, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
>>> While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.

     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can jump straight into questions from [Safe] [ph] Technologies.
     The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
     And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
     So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
>>> It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
     But now we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
     So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing.
     And so that's something that we've accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be and I think Iâ€™ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become the leader in the space.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof.

     Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
     Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I'm personally extremely excited to build HVAC â€“ gas, HVAC system that also has sort of hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
     And these are all things we've achieved in our cars.
     In fact, I don't know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
     They're very big.
     So â€“ but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable filter â€“

Elon Musk

Yeah.
>>> Itâ€™s not like model 3 and Y â€“ Model 3 and Y also â€“ they're way better than any other cars to the best of my knowledge.
     They're not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal car.
     And we're continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y.
     These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
     It's reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
     So it's really â€“ air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
     So taking all those things that we've replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is just very exciting.
     And then you've got â€“ if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you.
     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
>>> Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
-----
23. [Sentence #391, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
     Elon Musk

It's good.
     We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
     So it's tax.
     It's not make the product worse.
     It's -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how we can make it lighter and simpler.
     And so it's -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
>>> But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that andâ€¦[Technical Difficulty].
     Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, your conference will resume momentarily.
     Thank you.
     Speakers, you're back online.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason.
     What was the question again?
     Okay.
-----
24. [Sentence #1030, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     I mean, it's worth telling that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.
     Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 pack tax credit.
     And yet our sales have continued to do well.
     Yes.
     Zach Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
     That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
>>> Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.
     You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, particularly full self-driving, there's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will expand as we release more features.
     And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network.
     Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
     There's still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
     So we continue to see efficiencies there.
     So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
     And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
-----
25. [Sentence #982, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.
     We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
     The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
     So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
     Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
     And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
>>> And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
     They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
     And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
     And it's continuing to do more and more internally.
     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
     Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
     After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
>>> In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
     Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
     We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.

27. [Sentence #1259, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
>>> As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.

     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
     And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.

29. [Sentence #886, TSLA_Q2_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
     What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume production later this year.
     So, we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies.
     And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
     So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
     We use very little cobalt in our system already and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y.
     No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
     Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
     What are the biggest constraints now?
     Elon Musk

Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
     Okay.
     Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
     As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.

     Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
     What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
>>> It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
     So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
