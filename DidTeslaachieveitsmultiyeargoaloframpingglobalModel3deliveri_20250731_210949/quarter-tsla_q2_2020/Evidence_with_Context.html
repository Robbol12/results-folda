    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
    And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll be doing Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Y for the eastern half of North America.</span>
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.

    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span class="r2">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span class="r4">20</span><span class="r4"> million units </span>
<span class="r4">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span class="r4">beyond Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.
    Let&#x27;s see, is there anything more I want to say about?
    There&#x27;s a lot of information.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">348</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    It will be just awesome.
    Yes.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And there’s like two general classes of cell.
    There&#x27;s like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer 
range.
    Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack 
you have to subtract in cargo.
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive </span>
<span class="r4">coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total </span>
<span class="r4">vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron </span>
<span class="r4">phosphate battery pack in Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.</span>
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard <span class="r2">3</span> Range version of Model Y.
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">101</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non-critical patent projects.
    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>
<span class="r4">Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai.</span>
    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span class="r2">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span class="r2">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span class="r2">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span class="r2">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">498</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    I mean, it&#x27;s worth telling that we&#x27;re -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received <span class="r2">0</span> federal tax credit.
    Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $<span class="r2">7</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> pack tax credit.
    And yet our sales have continued to do well.
    Yes.
    Zach Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
    That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.</span>
    You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, 
particularly full self-driving, there&#x27;s the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will 
expand as we release more features.
    And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network.
    Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
    There&#x27;s still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the 
company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
    So we continue to see efficiencies there.
    So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
    And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span class="r2">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span class="r2">5</span>% to <span class="r2">10</span>% a month, from <span class="r2">40</span> -- it was 
like <span class="r2">40</span>% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like <span class="r2">80</span>% by the end of this year, maybe more.

    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
    Elon Musk

Well, I&#x27;d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
    Okay.
    Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don&#x27;t wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some 
high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
    As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.

    Or maybe play games and do work.
    That&#x27;s in the future.
    We&#x27;re already putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, we have been experimenting on that.
    So, FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity in the near-term.
    But we&#x27;re putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right.
    So, premium connectivity subscription is something that we&#x27;ve put in place.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard </span>
<span class="r4">Range Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats.</span>
    So, these are things that we have and we&#x27;re continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can 
launch and we&#x27;ll trickle those in with time.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But they&#x27;re all very tiny compared with like the step change to full self-driving depending upon how you calculate 
it is probably worth at least $<span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> per car.
    So, it&#x27;s a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The third question is also about Autopilot.
    What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones?
