     So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Now let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
     Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
     You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
>>> Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
     It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
     And that this [indiscernible] we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
     We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1.
     That’s insane.
     So, I think we need to unwind that.
     I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
     And then we then they can do their regular jobs.

     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles.
     All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
     We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving.
     We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
     And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
     We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
>>> Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
     As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
     This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
     This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
     So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries occurred in literally the final 10 days of Q1.
     As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted.
     As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
     The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.

And also, not only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S. So, it’s from all the Model 3 trade-ins, Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
     Elon Musk

Yes, for sure.
     People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.

Martin Viecha

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
     Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
     A couple of questions.
>>> One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments?
     Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
     I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
     I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
     And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
     And just under $50,000 ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
     And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over 50% of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs [indiscernible].
-----
4. [Sentence #40] [PLAN]
     It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made several years ago.
     There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.
     And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
     And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
     So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
     Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only 70% of previous Model 3 have actually been non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
     They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model 3.
>>> And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
     So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
     If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
     And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
     So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
     So, they have a longer range.
     The Model S now has a range of 370 miles.
     This would actually be at a range of 370 miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster and they were any headwind as well.

5. [Sentence #75] [PLAN]
     Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
     The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.
     And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
     We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward.
     I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month 1 in the history of the company.
     On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.
     This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half.
>>> This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
     We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
     So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for Model 3 and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
     The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
     So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
     We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
     On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
     $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28.
-----
6. [Sentence #91] [PLAN]
     There is an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
     Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
     If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
     Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 20%.
     This is due to two factors.
     One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as the makeshift towards the standard range lineup which we launched.
     We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
>>> In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model 3.
     In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
     Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February 28.
     Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
     As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
     From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
     So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
     As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model 3 in the U.S. and then 50% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.

7. [Sentence #62] [PLAN]
     The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version 3 on the energy side.
     And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the world.
     And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
     And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
     Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
>>> The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the quarter.
     We launched the standard range lineup for Model 3 product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
     So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&A around cash and profitability for the quarter.
     First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
     This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two factors.
     The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1.
     Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.
     The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas.

     We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1.
     That’s insane.
     So, I think we need to unwind that.
     I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
     And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
     So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
-----
9. [Sentence #225] [PLAN]
     That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
     So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
     It’s already increasing.
     Pierre Ferragu

And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am surprised you don’t – you just still expect a loss.
     So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a profit for similar volumes?
     How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much is related to pricing and other things?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
>>> So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.
     And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it’s West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars.
     But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just – not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive efforts from Tesla team.
     So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
     And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
     Two other things that I would add.

     All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.

     The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
     This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
     In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost 60%.
