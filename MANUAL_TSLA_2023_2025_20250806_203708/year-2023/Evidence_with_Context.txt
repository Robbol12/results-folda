[Year 2023] cybertruck deliverys; cybertruck production; cybertruck

1. [Sentence #637, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PILOT]
     So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
     That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
     It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
     And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
     We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so.
     And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it’s really dedicated.
     It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development.
>>> With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin.
     I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
     This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage.
     So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
     So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.
     And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter.
     So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really maximize the utility of the volume.
     And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.

2. [Sentence #1217, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month.
     In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform.
     We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
     Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to investor questions.
     The first investor question comes from Craig.
>>> How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
     Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
     Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
     And like I said, there’s no way around that.
     If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not that hard.
     But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
     You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
     So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.

3. [Sentence #1166, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
>>> The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

4. [Sentence #175, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
     How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
     Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
     And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think.
     And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
     So it will not be disappointed at all.
     It's amazing.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.

5. [Sentence #24, TSLA_Q1_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
>>> Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
     As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.

6. [Sentence #1364, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.
     But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering.
     I have been through it many times.
     Then, here we go again.
     Will Stein

Similar path for the next-gen platform?
     Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.
     I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.
     Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.
     And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.
     And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.
     It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.
     So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
     Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.

     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
     In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck.
     I think it will be quite a fast ramp.
     As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.

9. [Sentence #1599, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     While that’s now 14 years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in 2008 at 6 p.m. December 24th, Christmas Eve.
     And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.
     So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009.
     So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty.
     A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Like in Giga Texas.
     You said we still have room in this building.
>>> It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line.
     There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.
     Elon Musk

We also have 2,000 acres here.
     Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also…

Elon Musk

We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have.
     We could technically do all the scaling, research just here.
     So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area only has 2 million people.
     So people are moving here and they’re willing to move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis.
     They got to live somewhere.
