[Multi-Year Analysis] cybertruck deliverys; cybertruck production; cybertruck

1. [Sentence #637, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PILOT]
     So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
     That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
     It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
     And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
     We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so.
     And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it’s really dedicated.
     It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development.
>>> With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin.
     I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
     This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage.
     So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
     So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.
     And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter.
     So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really maximize the utility of the volume.
     And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.

2. [Sentence #1217, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month.
     In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform.
     We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
     Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to investor questions.
     The first investor question comes from Craig.
>>> How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
     Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
     Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
     And like I said, there’s no way around that.
     If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not that hard.
     But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
     You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
     So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
-----
3. [Sentence #1166, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
>>> The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
-----
4. [Sentence #175, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
     How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
     Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
     And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think.
     And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
     So it will not be disappointed at all.
     It's amazing.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
-----
5. [Sentence #24, TSLA_Q1_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
>>> Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
     As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
-----
6. [Sentence #2977, TSLA_Q2_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving.
     It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
     So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
     I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
     So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
     That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
     Travis Axelrod

Thank you very much.
>>> Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
     Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
     Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
     Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
     Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
     Lars Moravy

Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
     We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
     We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that.
-----
7. [Sentence #2425, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

5 million cars?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
-----
8. [Sentence #1364, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.
     But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering.
     I have been through it many times.
     Then, here we go again.
     Will Stein

Similar path for the next-gen platform?
     Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.
     I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.
     Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.
     And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.
     And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.
     It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.
     So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
-----
9. [Sentence #27, TSLA_Q1_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.

     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
     Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.

     So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
     In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck.
     I think it will be quite a fast ramp.
     As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.
-----
11. [Sentence #1599, TSLA_Q3_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     While that’s now 14 years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in 2008 at 6 p.m. December 24th, Christmas Eve.
     And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas.
     So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009.
     So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty.
     A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Like in Giga Texas.
     You said we still have room in this building.
>>> It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line.
     There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.
     Elon Musk

We also have 2,000 acres here.
     Unidentified Company Representative

There’s also…

Elon Musk

We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have.
     We could technically do all the scaling, research just here.
     So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area only has 2 million people.
     So people are moving here and they’re willing to move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis.
     They got to live somewhere.
-----
12. [Sentence #1386, TSLA_Q3_2023] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Let’s be clear, it will be cool, but it’s utilitarian.
     It’s not meant to be -- fill you with magic.
     It can get you from A to B.
     It will be still beautiful.
     But it’s utility.
     Unidentified Company Representative

That’s not 14 inches of [indiscernible] suspension.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> So I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.
     So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.
     But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
     And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.
-----
13. [Sentence #1170, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.

     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
     That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
     People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
     And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.
     But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.
-----
14. [Sentence #3613, TSLA_Q3_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, all the vehicles that we've really made, almost 7 million vehicles, the vast majority are capable of autonomy.
     And we're currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week.
     Compare that to, say, Waymo's entire fleet, it's less than -- they have less than 1,000 cars.
     We're making 35K a week.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
     And our cars look normal.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah, they mostly look normal.
>>> The Cybertruck looks, thankfully, abnormal.
     And the Cybercab, robotaxi, we wanted to have something futuristic-looking, and I think it does look futuristic.
     It's worth noting, with respect to the Cybercab, it's not -- it's especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution in vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with the Cybercab.
     The cycle times, like the units per hour of the Cybercab line, it is -- like this is just really something special.
     I mean, this is -- will be half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines, like -- not even the same league is what I'm saying, not in the same league.
     So, it's -- and I said like several years ago that maybe the most -- the hottest Tesla product probably will be the battery.
     You can't just, like, buy a factory.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, you can't reverse engineer a factory.
-----
15. [Sentence #762, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     This is a question we get asked a lot.
     So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
     This is a onetime amnesty.
     So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames.
     So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
     This is a onetime thing.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
>>> The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?
     Elon Musk

Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.
     So, that’s really not an issue.
     I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.
     It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle.
     So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain and internal production.
     So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth.
     We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps.
-----
16. [Sentence #1932, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more.
     But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Definitely is.
     Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It's like finally, the future.
     Looks like the future.
>>> It's just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the Cybertruck.
     That's our best product ever.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     We will strive to do so starting from this quarter.
     And just a brief update from the business perspective.
-----
17. [Sentence #1179, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.

     And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.
     But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.
     That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla.
>>> So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
     It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor.
     I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
     The demand is off the charts.
     We have over 1 million people who’ve reserved the car.
     So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.
     The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.

     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you for taking the questions.
     First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform.
     You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain.
     Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
     And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries.
>>> To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don't think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
     We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
     When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
     You don't just throw it on the line and just build it.
     So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
     Sure, 48 volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well.
     We're also open to partnering.

     And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the line.
     Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
     Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
     That would also bring some savings from higher production.
>>> But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.
     So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
     And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over 15 pounds right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
     You’re still fat.
     So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
     That’s the actual way.

And it’s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     Thank you.
     Just as a follow-up, I recognize there’s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you’re sticking with your near term, your volume target of 50% CAGR.
>>> As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution.
     There’s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth.
     But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
     Elon Musk

It’s not about getting more share.
     It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today.
     Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week.
     If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish.
     If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.

     So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames.
     So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
     This is a onetime thing.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?
     Elon Musk

Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.
     So, that’s really not an issue.
>>> I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.
     It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle.
     So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain and internal production.
     So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth.
     We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps.
     But first order approximation, there’s like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck.
     And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the 10,000.
     So, it’s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year.

22. [Sentence #2939, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
     It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
     Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
>>> Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
     Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.

     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
>>> Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.

     So, it’s just that they happen -- it will happen -- is that the -- it starts this year, spans next year and gets to 2025.
     So technically, there are three calendar years in there, but there’s actually only 18 months, not three years.
     I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.
     But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering.
     I have been through it many times.
     Then, here we go again.
     Will Stein

Similar path for the next-gen platform?
>>> Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.
     I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.
     Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.
     And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.
     And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.
     It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.

     It's pretty wild, especially the sort of subsystem test stands where you've just got like one leg on a test stand, just doing repetitive exercises and one arm on a test stand.
     Pretty wild.
     Yeah.
     Karn Budhiraj

We're not entering Westworld anytime soon.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     You take safety very, very seriously.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question from Nermin is, how many Cybertruck orders are in the queue and when do you anticipate you will be able to fulfill existing orders?
     Karn Budhiraj

First of all, I want to thank all the Cybertruck reservation holders for their patience.
     The reservation to order conversion rates so far has been very, very encouraging.
     If the trend continues as it very likely to be, we will soon sold out all the builds in 2024.
     And also, we have new orders come in after the launch.
     The auto numbers keep growing.
     So we're now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.

     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
>>> This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
     That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
     People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
     And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.
     But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.
     That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla.

     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yes.
     Yeah.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, that's not sandbagging or anything else.
     Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter.
     A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.
     So, you don't expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
     A Cybercab looks different.
>>> A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model 3 are -- look, they're good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
     You don't expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it does.
     So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we're doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another sort of 30-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
     And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.
     So, the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the 10/10 event.
     Yes.
     So, there's no need to wait for robotaxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy.
     We expect to achieve that next year with the -- with our existing vehicle line.

     Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
     Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
     Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
     Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
     Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
     Lars Moravy

Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
     We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
>>> We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that.
     We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is any update on Dojo?
     Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware.
     And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.
     And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them.

     How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
     When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
     First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
     So, in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas.
     So, congrats to the team for that.
     Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.
>>> Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production.
     That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
     As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell.
     Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis.
     We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
     Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

     So we're now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation.
     And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery.
     So -- but really, the demand is off the hook.
>>> As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more.
     But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.

Definitely is.
     Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
