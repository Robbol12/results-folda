1. [Sentence #203] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

5 million cars?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
