    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the </span><span class="r5">2020</span><span class="r5"> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r3">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">41</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span class="r3">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span class="r3">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span class="r3">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve </span>
<span class="r5">got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the </span>
<span class="r5">full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span class="r3">10</span> years.
    If you look back <span class="r3">10</span> years from today to <span class="r3">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> times more cars in <span class="r3">2020</span> then we 
produced in <span class="r3">2010</span>, <span class="r3">8</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
    So where we will be in <span class="r3">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.

Thank you.
    Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla  network app before full autonomy and change
the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
    If so when will this happen?
    Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.
    Elon Musk

Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this 
happen.
    On <span class="r3">2019</span> a few key points I&#x27;d like to highlight.
    On demand, while we&#x27;ve mentioned a few times, it&#x27;s worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we&#x27;ve 
transitioned entirely from generating Model <span class="r3">3</span> orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
