[Year Q2] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #766, TSLA_Q2_2021] [PLAN]
     It does seem as though over time, I mean, just an observation, I think, I will basically step back that neural net-based computing or AI-based computing is more and more of the compute stack.
     We are -- conventional computing is called perhaps [inaudible] based computing.
     It’s still going to be important, it’s still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute.
     So anyway, long story, but I think, probably, others will want to use it too and we will make it available.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the second question from retail investors.
     The recent price changes on Solar Roof have been a bit discouraging for customers and investors.
>>> Could Tesla share more about Solar Roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.
     1,000 roofs per week?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
     So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the Solar Roofs.
     So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
     We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
     Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
-----
2. [Sentence #56, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar.
     So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States.
     And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee.
     So we're very confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the Solar Retrofit or Solar Roof.
     Our Solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average.
     After the Federal Tax Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt.
     And it's very simple, highly automated single-click experience.
>>> So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing roof either way, we're the company to go to.
     And then you also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility.
     So I think that product is really coming together and it's only going to get better later this year.
     So just very excited about that business potential.
     On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range.
     So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles.
     I mean, you basically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrive.
     And this is at highway speed.
-----
3. [Sentence #780, TSLA_Q2_2021] [PLAN]
     Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
     So, you just can’t have a one size fits all situation.
     If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is not strong enough to hold the Solar Roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times what our initial quotes were.
     So in those cases, what we obviously have to do is to refund customers their deposit.
     What we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money.
     We have just got to provide a refund of the deposit.
     But what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we are shifting the whole solar situation, the solar power, basically the solar factory situation to, there’s only one product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
>>> That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solar Glass Roof.
     But in all cases, it will have the Powerwall to temporary this -- and this is essentially the Powerwall to a plus if you will, the plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
     So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the specification on the website.
     They are about twice the power capability, roughly.
     It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about oddly twice the steady-state power of the specification on the website.
     The energy is the same but the power is roughly double.
     And all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficult the installation will dramatically increase -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less, it will be much easier, because the power from the Solar Roof, the Solar Glass Roof, or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.
     And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility mains, right, between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house.

4. [Sentence #52, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Well, I'm sure they have lots of questions.
     We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
     So it's already underway, started this weekend.
     Let's see, moving on to other subjects, Solar.
     We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar.
     So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States.
     And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee.

     So just very excited about that business potential.

5. [Sentence #1828, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
     On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
     In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
     Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
     It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of 20 years of recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
     On the residential side, we have some fun things happening.
     We recently surpassed 0.5 million Powerwalls installed.
>>> Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof.
     Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT.
     We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access.
     And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter.
     Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
     In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.
     For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.

     Yes.
     And specific to that, we are on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next 13.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We -- exactly.
     We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     And I had a quick follow-up on – maybe, Zach, for you on your Energy business.
>>> So I understand like the negative gross margin with Solar Roof ran.
     But I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the Storage business and where are you -- what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business?
     I guess it’s going to grow in the mix in coming years, so it’s important for long-term modeling.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     We are seeing a lot of…

Elon Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicles.
     But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than storage.
     So we are already are at good margins with the Powerwall, but some additional work is needed for the Megapack to achieve good margins.
     Yes, Drew, what do you think?

10. [Sentence #50, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     So anything, guys?

12. [Sentence #705, TSLA_Q2_2021] [PLAN]
     While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
     We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
     If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
     This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
     So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
     On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overheads.
     On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
>>> This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.
     We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall.
     We are working as fast as we can to increase production and this will aid in profitability of this business as those volumes increase.
     On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which was driven by our investments in technology and growth.
     In particular for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells, investments in the new SNX, and our neural net and silicon investments.
     On the SG&A side, we are setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to come there.
     And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
     Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant working capital headwinds from SNX.

     You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.
     Effectively almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.
     So this is extremely important for scalability.
     It’s the only way to do it, really.
     And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house or apartment or whatever the case may be, will be its own utility.
     And so even if all the lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power.
