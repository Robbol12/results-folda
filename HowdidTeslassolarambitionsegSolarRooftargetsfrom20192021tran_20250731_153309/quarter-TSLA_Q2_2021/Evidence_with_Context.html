    It does seem as though over time, I mean, just an observation, I think, I will basically step back that neural 
net-based computing or AI-based computing is more and more of the compute stack.
    We are -- conventional computing is called perhaps  based computing.
    It’s still going to be important, it’s still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will 
become a bigger and bigger portion of compute.

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to the second question from retail investors.
    The recent price changes on Solar Roof have been a bit discouraging for customers and investors.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could Tesla share more about Solar Roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.</span>
    <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> roofs per week?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
    So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to 
install the Solar Roofs.
    So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
    We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the 
complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
    Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.

    Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
    So, you just can’t have a one size fits all situation.
    If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is not 
strong enough to hold the Solar Roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times what our initial quotes were.
    So in those cases, what we obviously have to do is to refund customers their deposit.
    What we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money.
    We have just got to provide a refund of the deposit.
    But what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we 
are shifting the whole solar situation, the solar power, basically the solar factory situation to, there’s only one 
product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solar </span>
<span class="r5">Glass Roof.</span>
    But in all cases, it will have the Powerwall to temporary this -- and this is essentially the Powerwall to a plus if
you will, the plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
    So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the
specification on the website.
    They are about twice the power capability, roughly.
    It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about oddly twice the steady-state power of 
the specification on the website.
    The energy is the same but the power is roughly double.
    And all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficult the installation will dramatically increase -- or the 
difficulty of the installation will be much less, it will be much easier, because the power from the Solar Roof, the 
Solar Glass Roof, or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.
    And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility mains, right, between the utility and the main power panel 
of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house.

    Yes.
    And specific to that, we are on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next <span class="r3">13</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We -- exactly.
    We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And I had a quick follow-up on – maybe, Zach, for you on your Energy business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I understand like the negative gross margin with Solar Roof ran.</span>
    But I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the Storage business and where are you --
what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business?
    I guess it’s going to grow in the mix in coming years, so it’s important for long-term modeling.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We are seeing a lot of…

Elon Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicles.
    But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than storage.
    So we are already are at good margins with the Powerwall, but some additional work is needed for the Megapack to 
achieve good margins.
    Yes, Drew, what do you think?

    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
    If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
    This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure 
as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
    So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as 
some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
    On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the
used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb 
fixed overheads.
    On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.</span>
    We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall.
    We are working as fast as we can to increase production and this will aid in profitability of this business as those
volumes increase.
    On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which was driven by our investments in technology and growth.
    In particular for R&amp;D, this includes the structural battery pack and <span class="r3">4680</span> cells, investments in the new SNX, and our
neural net and silicon investments.
    On the SG&amp;A side, we are setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to 
come there.
    And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
    Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant
working capital headwinds from SNX.

    You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.
    Effectively almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and 
requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.
    So this is extremely important for scalability.
    It’s the only way to do it, really.
    And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house or apartment or whatever the case may be,
will be its own utility.
    And so even if all the lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power.
