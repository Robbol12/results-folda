[Multi-Year Analysis] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #52]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) So we're very confident that people will have our **solar** product, whether it's the **Solar** Retrofit or **Solar** **Roof**.
2. [Sentence #56]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new **roof** or Tesla **Solar** **Roof** or you want **Solar** on your existing **roof** either way, we're the company to go to.
3. [Sentence #85]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass **Roof** installations in California?
4. [Sentence #87]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the **Solar** **Roof**, which impacted overall profitability.
5. [Sentence #131]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Just this week, we are launching Charge on **Solar**, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess **solar** and drive only on the sunshine that hits their **roof**.
6. [Sentence #131]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in **solar**.
7. [Sentence #135]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit **Solar** and Tesla **Roof**.
8. [Sentence #136]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And we're confident we'll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla **Solar**, whether it's retrofit or but [indiscernible] **roof** before the end of the year.
9. [Sentence #153]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) **Solar** **Roof** is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in the installation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
10. [Sentence #154]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) We've recently demonstrated our ability to complete **Solar** **Roof** installation in just one day.
11. [Sentence #160]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) The recent price changes on **Solar** **Roof** have been a bit discouraging for customers and investors.
12. [Sentence #161]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) Could Tesla share more about **Solar** **Roof** challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.
13. [Sentence #161]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) Could Tesla share more about **Solar** **Roof** challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.
14. [Sentence #164]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) First of all, I should say, the demand for the **Solar** **Roof** remains strong.
15. [Sentence #164]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) First of all, I should say, the demand for the **Solar** **Roof** remains strong.
16. [Sentence #174]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) But what is I think most important about the **Solar** **Roof** situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we are shifting the whole **solar** situation, the **solar** power, basically the **solar** factory situation to, there’s only one product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house **solar** without a Powerwall.
17. [Sentence #174]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) But what is I think most important about the **Solar** **Roof** situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we are shifting the whole **solar** situation, the **solar** power, basically the **solar** factory situation to, there’s only one product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house **solar** without a Powerwall.
18. [Sentence #175]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) That **solar** could either be **solar** retrofit with conventional panels put on the **roof** or it can be the Tesla **Solar** Glass **Roof**.
19. [Sentence #175]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) That **solar** could either be **solar** retrofit with conventional panels put on the **roof** or it can be the Tesla **Solar** Glass **Roof**.
20. [Sentence #188]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) I'm Carl, I'm on the **Solar** **Roof** engineering and installation.
21. [Sentence #193]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Also, we've had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they're ramping up installations for **Solar** **Roof** on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.
22. [Sentence #203]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Is this still in line with Tesla's **ambitions** for the next five to 10 years?
23. [Sentence #231]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) The next question is, can you give us an update on **Solar** **Roof** ramp?
24. [Sentence #234]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Elon Musk

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the **Solar** **Roof** before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
25. [Sentence #239]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) So – but I think the long-term trend for **Solar** **Roof** is extremely good, and I'm confident that, let's say, within the next, I don't know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of 1,000 a week.
26. [Sentence #242]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit 1,000 a week plus build rate for the **Solar** Glass **Roof** already.
27. [Sentence #245]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 **Solar** **Roof** install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week **roof** installations.
28. [Sentence #248]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) So it's really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry to also install **Solar** **Roof** that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week.
29. [Sentence #352]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their **solar** **roof** product?
30. [Sentence #370]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) So, it's like I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla **Solar** **Roof** and the Powerwall.
