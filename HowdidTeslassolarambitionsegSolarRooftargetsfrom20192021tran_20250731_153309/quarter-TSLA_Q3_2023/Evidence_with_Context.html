    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r3">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r5">2.3</span><span class="r5"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5">, representing </span><span class="r5">28</span><span class="r5">% growth </span>
<span class="r5">versus </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r3">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r3">50</span>% long-term CAGR?

When we look at <span class="r3">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r3">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
