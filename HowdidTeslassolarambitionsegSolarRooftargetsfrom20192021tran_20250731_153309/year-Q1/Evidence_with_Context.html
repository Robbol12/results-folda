    It does seem as though over time, I mean, just an observation, I think, I will basically step back that neural 
net-based computing or AI-based computing is more and more of the compute stack.
    We are -- conventional computing is called perhaps  based computing.
    It’s still going to be important, it’s still going to be very important, but it will become -- but neural net will 
become a bigger and bigger portion of compute.

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to the second question from retail investors.
    The recent price changes on Solar Roof have been a bit discouraging for customers and investors.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could Tesla share more about Solar Roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.</span>
    <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> roofs per week?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
    So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to 
install the Solar Roofs.
    So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
    We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the 
complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
    Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">707</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
    So, you just can’t have a one size fits all situation.
    If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is not 
strong enough to hold the Solar Roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times what our initial quotes were.
    So in those cases, what we obviously have to do is to refund customers their deposit.
    What we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money.
    We have just got to provide a refund of the deposit.
    But what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we 
are shifting the whole solar situation, the solar power, basically the solar factory situation to, there’s only one 
product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solar </span>
<span class="r5">Glass Roof.</span>
    But in all cases, it will have the Powerwall to temporary this -- and this is essentially the Powerwall to a plus if
you will, the plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
    So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the
specification on the website.
    They are about twice the power capability, roughly.
    It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about oddly twice the steady-state power of 
the specification on the website.
    The energy is the same but the power is roughly double.
    And all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficult the installation will dramatically increase -- or the 
difficulty of the installation will be much less, it will be much easier, because the power from the Solar Roof, the 
Solar Glass Roof, or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.
    And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility mains, right, between the utility and the main power panel 
of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house.

    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies</span>
<span class="r5">in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> a week.</span>
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?

    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
    So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the
next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard

    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted</span>
<span class="r5">overall profitability.</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.

    Elon Musk

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both 
from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r3">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5"> years?</span>
    This would be <span class="r3">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2025</span> and more than <span class="r3">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r3">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r3">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r3">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r3">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r3">3</span>.

    Could Tesla share more about Solar Roof challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.
    <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> roofs per week?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
    So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to 
install the Solar Roofs.
    So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
    We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the 
complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">14</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">250</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from </span>
<span class="r5">China on the Solar Roof.</span>
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Yes.
    And specific to that, we are on track to more than double the supplier capacity over the next <span class="r3">13</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We -- exactly.
    We do expect from suppliers willing to receive double the cell output next year versus this year.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And I had a quick follow-up on – maybe, Zach, for you on your Energy business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I understand like the negative gross margin with Solar Roof ran.</span>
    But I was wondering, what do gross margin look like there when you look at the Storage business and where are you --
what’s your ambition in terms of gross margin in that business?
    I guess it’s going to grow in the mix in coming years, so it’s important for long-term modeling.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We are seeing a lot of…

Elon Musk

We are aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicles.
    But it is important to bear in mind that vehicle is more mature than storage.
    So we are already are at good margins with the Powerwall, but some additional work is needed for the Megapack to 
achieve good margins.
    Yes, Drew, what do you think?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">16</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">702</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
    So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to 
install the Solar Roofs.
    So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
    We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the 
complexity of roofs varies dramatically.
    Some roofs are literally two times or three times easier than other roofs.
    So, you just can’t have a one size fits all situation.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if the roof sort of the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is not </span>
<span class="r5">strong enough to hold the Solar Roof, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times what our initial quotes were.</span>
    So in those cases, what we obviously have to do is to refund customers their deposit.
    What we cannot do is go and just lose a massive amount of money.
    We have just got to provide a refund of the deposit.
    But what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we 
are shifting the whole solar situation, the solar power, basically the solar factory situation to, there’s only one 
product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
    That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solar 
Glass Roof.
    But in all cases, it will have the Powerwall to temporary this -- and this is essentially the Powerwall to a plus if
you will, the plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
    So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the
specification on the website.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new </span>
<span class="r5">Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…</span>

<span class="r5">Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">New technologies.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span class="r3">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and
most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">18</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">632</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
    If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
    This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure 
as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
    So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as 
some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
    On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the
used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb 
fixed overheads.
    On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.</span>
    We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall.
    We are working as fast as we can to increase production and this will aid in profitability of this business as those
volumes increase.
    On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which was driven by our investments in technology and growth.
    In particular for R&amp;D, this includes the structural battery pack and <span class="r3">4680</span> cells, investments in the new SNX, and our
neural net and silicon investments.
    On the SG&amp;A side, we are setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to 
come there.
    And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
    Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant
working capital headwinds from SNX.

    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage </span>
<span class="r5">deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy </span>
<span class="r5">business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.</span>
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span class="r3">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span class="r3">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">20</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2264</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span class="r3">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span class="r3">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
    We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our 
reach and driving demand for our products.
    Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of <span class="r3">24.6</span>%.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect the energy storage deployments for </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5"> to grow at least </span><span class="r5">75</span><span class="r5">% higher from </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5">.</span>
    And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
    Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our
control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
    On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future
projects, marketing, and other activities.
    We had negative free cash flow of $<span class="r3">2.5</span> billion in the first quarter.
    The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed 
before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
    We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span class="r3">10</span>%.

Thank you very much.

    First of all, I should say, the demand for the Solar Roof remains strong.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to </span>
<span class="r5">install the Solar Roofs.</span>
    So production has gone fine, but we are choked at the installation point.
    We did find that we basically made some significant mistakes in assessment of difficulty of certain roofs, but the

    But what is I think most important about the Solar Roof situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we 
are shifting the whole solar situation, the solar power, basically the solar factory situation to, there’s only one 
product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall.
    That solar could either be solar retrofit with conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solar 
Glass Roof.
    But in all cases, it will have the Powerwall to temporary this -- and this is essentially the Powerwall to a plus if
you will, the plus refers to a higher peak power capability.
    So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak power capability than the
specification on the website.
    They are about twice the power capability, roughly.
    It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about oddly twice the steady-state power of 
the specification on the website.
    The energy is the same but the power is roughly double.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficult the installation will dramatically increase -- or the </span>
<span class="r5">difficulty of the installation will be much less, it will be much easier, because the power from the Solar Roof, the </span>
<span class="r5">Solar Glass Roof, or the solar panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.</span>
    And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utility mains, right, between the utility and the main power panel 
of the house, which means you never need to touch the main circuit breakers of the house.
    You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.
    Effectively almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a unique work of art and 
requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.
    So this is extremely important for scalability.
    It’s the only way to do it, really.
    And this also means that every solar Powerwall installation that the house or apartment or whatever the case may be,
will be its own utility.
    And so even if all the lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power.
