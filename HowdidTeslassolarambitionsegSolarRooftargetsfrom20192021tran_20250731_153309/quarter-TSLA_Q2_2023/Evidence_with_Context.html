deployments through <span class="r3">2023</span>–<span class="r3">2024</span>?

    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.
    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span class="r3">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r3">20</span> years of 
recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
    On the residential side, we have some fun things happening.
    We recently surpassed <span class="r3">0.5</span> million Powerwalls installed.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their</span>
<span class="r5">vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof.</span>
    Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support 
to ERCOT.
    We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over 
time as ERCOT expands market access.
    And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model <span class="r3">3</span> owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle 
customers over the rest of the quarter.
    Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers
requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
    In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access 
that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.
    For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system 
buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.

Thank you very much.
