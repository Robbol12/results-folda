Yes.
    I&#x27;m Carl, I&#x27;m on the Solar Roof engineering and installation.
    The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and 
experienced.
    We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we&#x27;re continuing to hire.
    The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site.
    We&#x27;ve talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every 
installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, we&#x27;ve had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they&#x27;re ramping up installations for Solar </span>
<span class="r6">Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you, Carl.
    Elon Musk

I mean, here&#x27;s the way to think about that product, in my opinion.
    You have to say, I think what do you want the world to look like?
    When you look around the neighborhood future, decade from now, what do you want?
    What products are going to make your life better?
    What future do you want?
    And I think a future where we&#x27;ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better 
in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy.

    We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer 
orders.
    We&#x27;re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are 
providing services back to the grid when they don&#x27;t need to consume energy or have backup power.
    This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r3">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation </span>
<span class="r6">process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.</span>
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

    In the same way, gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting new transfer 
purchases to upgraded hardware?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We&#x27;ll give it some thought.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The fourth question is, what are the remaining constraints to be sold for solar installations to ramp significantly?

    And let’s go first to the shareholder questions.
    The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax 
credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each 
of <span class="r3">2023</span>, <span class="r3">2024</span> and <span class="r3">2025</span> through your existing and planned supply chain?
    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
    Do you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while 
also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well </span>
<span class="r6">positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly 
possible to get to <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially 
outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- 
simply from a property market mostly.
    And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
    The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more
than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
    Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.

    Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be the most valuable business units within Tesla 
over the next five to seven years?
    Could you envision any of them ever spinning out from Tesla?
    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I think about this today.
    Tesla there&#x27;s probably in excess of a dozen startups effectively in Tesla.

    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r3">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r6">2.3</span><span class="r6"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r6">2024</span><span class="r6">, representing </span><span class="r6">28</span><span class="r6">% growth </span>
<span class="r6">versus </span><span class="r6">2023</span><span class="r6"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r3">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r3">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r3">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r3">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
