    We&#x27;re still working on it.
    Just will trail the Hardware <span class="r3">4</span> releases.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thanks.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we&#x27;re going to have to upgrade people&#x27;s Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> computer for those that 
have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that&#x27;s going to be painful and difficult but we&#x27;ll get 
it done.
    Now I&#x27;m kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Elon.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
    Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
    It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
    We&#x27;ve worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing 
SKU count.
    And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of 
certified installers.
    And many of those, they&#x27;ve been installing solar for many years.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">370</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    But if it&#x27;s a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense.
    And it is a premium product.
    It&#x27;s like Model S, Model X or something, like it&#x27;s a premium product.
    I think it looks really cool.
    And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity.
    And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient.
    So, even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works, and your roof 
looks awesome.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s like I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla Solar Roof and the Powerwall.</span>
    Your life might depend on it.
    And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to help you because their computers don&#x27;t work because the
power went out and you can&#x27;t charge your phone.
    Actually, happens over time.
    You literally can&#x27;t even call anyone because your phone&#x27;s out.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thank you very much.
    The next question was covered in opening remarks so we will skip that.
    And the last question from say.com.

<span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">337</span><span class="r4">]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    That&#x27;s $<span class="r3">1</span> billion a month at some point probably.
    But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
    So, yes, $<span class="r3">1</span> billion a month is a lot but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s going to be like <span class="r3">1</span>% of Optimus.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> vehicles?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span class="r3">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
    So, we&#x27;re not giving up on Hardware.

That&#x27;s actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it&#x27;s just let the roof -- just supply products to the
roofing industry.

    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span class="r3">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
    Our free cash flow for the quarter was $<span class="r3">2</span> billion, and despite capex increase of over $<span class="r3">2.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2024</span>, we were 
able to generate free cash flow of $<span class="r3">3.6</span> billion for the year.
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span class="r3">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span class="r3">5</span> billion.
    And for <span class="r3">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, like Elon said, </span><span class="r6">2025</span><span class="r6"> is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.</span>
    There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the 
pace for the next phase of growth.
    And it is something which now I&#x27;m getting out on the floor, it is going to be out of this world.
    And we just are putting right foundation.
    And that&#x27;s all I have.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
