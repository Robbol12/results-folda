[Year Q4] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #41]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass **Roof**, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
2. [Sentence #44]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and **solar** retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
3. [Sentence #85]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass **Roof** installations in California?
4. [Sentence #86]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass **Roof**.
5. [Sentence #91]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And I think people will want a live **roof** that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it's the future we want.
6. [Sentence #556]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in **solar**?
7. [Sentence #564]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in **solar**.
8. [Sentence #568]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit **Solar** and Tesla **Roof**.
9. [Sentence #569]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) And we're confident we'll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla **Solar**, whether it's retrofit or but [indiscernible] **roof** before the end of the year.
10. [Sentence #2833]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.
11. [Sentence #2962]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) And if so, what is the **timeline** and expected impact to Tesla's capex?
12. [Sentence #2977]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their **solar** **roof** product?
13. [Sentence #2980]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Yes, **solar** **roof** is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
14. [Sentence #2985]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

That's actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it's just let the **roof** -- just supply products to the roofing industry.
15. [Sentence #2986]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) And especially when somebody's is getting a new **roof** anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by far the most efficient time to put in a **solar** **roof** as opposed to putting a **solar** **roof** on a house that -- where the **roof** still has 20 years of life.
16. [Sentence #2988]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) But if it's a new house or the **roof** needs to be replaced anyway, then **solar** **roof** can make a lot of sense.
17. [Sentence #2995]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) So, it's like I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla **Solar** **Roof** and the Powerwall.
