    Just will trail the Hardware <span class="r3">4</span> releases.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thanks.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we&#x27;re going to have to upgrade people&#x27;s Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> computer for those that 
have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that&#x27;s going to be painful and difficult but we&#x27;ll get 
it done.
    Now I&#x27;m kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.

<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
    Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
    It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
    We&#x27;ve worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing 
SKU count.
    And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of 
certified installers.
    And many of those, they&#x27;ve been installing solar for many years.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It&#x27;s -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model <span class="r3">3</span> production 
and building.
    We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
    But now we got a little more bandwidth, we&#x27;re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
    So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows 
us to have industry-leading pricing.
    And so that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the 
place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become
the leader in the space.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar</span>
<span class="r6">and Tesla Roof.</span>
    And we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, 
whether it&#x27;s retrofit or but  roof before the end of the year.
    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.
    As Zach mentioned, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we&#x27;re making 
great progress in that regard.
    And I think we&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s really dialed in this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
    This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increased sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on used 
vehicles.

    But if it&#x27;s a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense.
    And it is a premium product.
    It&#x27;s like Model S, Model X or something, like it&#x27;s a premium product.
    I think it looks really cool.
    And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity.
    And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient.
    So, even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works, and your roof 
looks awesome.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s like I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla Solar Roof and the Powerwall.</span>
    Your life might depend on it.
    And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to help you because their computers don&#x27;t work because the
power went out and you can&#x27;t charge your phone.
    Actually, happens over time.
    You literally can&#x27;t even call anyone because your phone&#x27;s out.

    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance

    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the </span><span class="r6">2020</span><span class="r6"> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r3">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.

    That&#x27;s $<span class="r3">1</span> billion a month at some point probably.
    But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
    So, yes, $<span class="r3">1</span> billion a month is a lot but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s going to be like <span class="r3">1</span>% of Optimus.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> vehicles?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span class="r3">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span class="r3">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
    So, we&#x27;re not giving up on Hardware.

    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span class="r3">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span class="r3">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span class="r3">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve </span>
<span class="r6">got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the </span>
<span class="r6">full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span class="r3">10</span> years.
    If you look back <span class="r3">10</span> years from today to <span class="r3">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> times more cars in <span class="r3">2020</span> then we 
produced in <span class="r3">2010</span>, <span class="r3">8</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
    So where we will be in <span class="r3">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.

    Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X 
production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
    Additionally, we&#x27;re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port 
capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
    We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including
OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    Global demand continues to outpace production, and we&#x27;re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
    I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.

    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.

    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r3">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r3">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews

or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the </span>
<span class="r6">future we want.</span>
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla  network app before full autonomy and change
the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
    If so when will this happen?
    Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.
    Elon Musk

Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?

    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
    Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
    It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
    We&#x27;ve worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing 
SKU count.
    And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of 
certified installers.
    And many of those, they&#x27;ve been installing solar for many years.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect</span>

<span class="r6">That&#x27;s actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it&#x27;s just let the roof -- just supply products to the</span>
<span class="r6">roofing industry.</span>
    And especially when somebody&#x27;s is getting a new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by 
far the most efficient time to put in a solar roof as opposed to putting a solar roof on a house that -- where the roof 
still has <span class="r3">20</span> years of life.
    That&#x27;s not economically senseful.
    But if it&#x27;s a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense.
    And it is a premium product.
    It&#x27;s like Model S, Model X or something, like it&#x27;s a premium product.
    I think it looks really cool.
    And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">16</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">44</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span class="r3">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span class="r3">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span class="r3">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
    And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve 
got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the 
full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span class="r3">10</span> years.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you look back </span><span class="r6">10</span><span class="r6"> years from today to </span><span class="r6">2010</span><span class="r6">, we will produce approximately a </span><span class="r6">1</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> times more cars in </span><span class="r6">2020</span><span class="r6"> then we </span>
<span class="r6">produced in </span><span class="r6">2010</span><span class="r6">, </span><span class="r6">8</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.</span>
    So where we will be in <span class="r3">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this 
happen.
    On <span class="r3">2019</span> a few key points I&#x27;d like to highlight.
    On demand, while we&#x27;ve mentioned a few times, it&#x27;s worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we&#x27;ve 
transitioned entirely from generating Model <span class="r3">3</span> orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">17</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">2833</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span class="r3">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
    Our free cash flow for the quarter was $<span class="r3">2</span> billion, and despite capex increase of over $<span class="r3">2.4</span> billion in <span class="r3">2024</span>, we were 
able to generate free cash flow of $<span class="r3">3.6</span> billion for the year.
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span class="r3">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span class="r3">5</span> billion.
    And for <span class="r3">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, like Elon said, </span><span class="r6">2025</span><span class="r6"> is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.</span>
    There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the 
pace for the next phase of growth.
    And it is something which now I&#x27;m getting out on the floor, it is going to be out of this world.
    And we just are putting right foundation.
    And that&#x27;s all I have.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
