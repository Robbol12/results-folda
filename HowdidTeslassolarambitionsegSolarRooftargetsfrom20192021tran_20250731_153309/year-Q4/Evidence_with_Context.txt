[Year Q4] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #2977, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     We're still working on it.
     Just will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thanks.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done.
     Now I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Elon.
>>> The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
     Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
     It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
     We've worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing SKU count.
     And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of certified installers.
     And many of those, they've been installing solar for many years.

2. [Sentence #568, TSLA_Q4_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
     But now we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
     So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing.
     And so that's something that we've accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become the leader in the space.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof.
     And we're confident we'll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or but [indiscernible] roof before the end of the year.
     So it's really – I think we've got a good strategy.
     As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.
     And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
     This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increased sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on used vehicles.

     But if it's a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense.
     And it is a premium product.
     It's like Model S, Model X or something, like it's a premium product.
     I think it looks really cool.
     And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity.
     And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient.
     So, even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works, and your roof looks awesome.
>>> So, it's like I recommend anyone who can afford it, get the Tesla Solar Roof and the Powerwall.
     Your life might depend on it.
     And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to help you because their computers don't work because the power went out and you can't charge your phone.
     Actually, happens over time.
     You literally can't even call anyone because your phone's out.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thank you very much.
     The next question was covered in opening remarks so we will skip that.
     And the last question from say.com.

5. [Sentence #564, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
     And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
     So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
     It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.

     We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
     So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
     However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.
     Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY [ph] Technologies.
     So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
>>> What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
     So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in North America on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
     So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation.
     But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form or another.
     It's really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
     And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it's the future we want.
     So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.

7. [Sentence #2962, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     That's $1 billion a month at some point probably.
     But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.
     So, yes, $1 billion a month is a lot but it's not it's going to be like 1% of Optimus.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
     Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles?
>>> And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's capex?
     I think they're referring to cost there.
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They're really asking the tough questions, aren't they?
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven't started working on Hardware 3 yet.
     We are still making software releases.
     We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously.
     People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
     So, we're not giving up on Hardware.

     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

That's actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it's just let the roof -- just supply products to the roofing industry.
>>> And especially when somebody's is getting a new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by far the most efficient time to put in a solar roof as opposed to putting a solar roof on a house that -- where the roof still has 20 years of life.
     That's not economically senseful.
     But if it's a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense.

10. [Sentence #41, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we've never seen anything like it basically.
     I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
     So -- as many -- we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts.
     So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don't even have enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it, it's just great.
     So and then stepping back in 2018 from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than $1 billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production.
     So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of the Tesla team and I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.
     I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
>>> And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
     So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
     If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
     So where we will be in 10 years, very excited to consider the prospect.

     Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
     Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
     We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
     Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
     I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.

     This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this happen.
     On 2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight.
     On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.

     It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
     Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite capex increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year.
     Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
     While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits.
     The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13.
     Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $5 billion.
     And for 2025, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
>>> In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.
     There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the pace for the next phase of growth.
