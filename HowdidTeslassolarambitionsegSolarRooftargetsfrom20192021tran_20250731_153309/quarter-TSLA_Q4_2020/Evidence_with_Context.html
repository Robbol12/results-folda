    It&#x27;s -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model <span class="r3">3</span> production 
and building.
    We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
    But now we got a little more bandwidth, we&#x27;re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
    So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows 
us to have industry-leading pricing.
    And so that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the 
place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become
the leader in the space.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar</span>
<span class="r6">and Tesla Roof.</span>
    And we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, 
whether it&#x27;s retrofit or but  roof before the end of the year.
    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.
    As Zach mentioned, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we&#x27;re making 
great progress in that regard.
    And I think we&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s really dialed in this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
    This would be a huge for loyalty and overall increased sales of vehicles who are offering more FSD sales on used 
vehicles.

Unfortunately, we&#x27;re not considering that at this time.

Yeah.
    So we&#x27;re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
    And we had our best quarter since, I think, <span class="r3">2018</span> in Q4.
    So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.

    Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X 
production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
    Additionally, we&#x27;re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port 
capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
    We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including
OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    Global demand continues to outpace production, and we&#x27;re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
    I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can jump straight into questions from <span class="r2">[</span>Safe<span class="r2">]</span>  Technologies.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share</span>
<span class="r6">leader in solar?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    So we&#x27;re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
    And we had our best quarter since, I think, <span class="r3">2018</span> in Q4.
    So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
    It&#x27;s -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model <span class="r3">3</span> production
