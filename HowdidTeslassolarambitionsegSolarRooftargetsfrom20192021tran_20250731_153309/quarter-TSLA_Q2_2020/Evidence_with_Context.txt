[TSLA_Q2_2020] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #56] [UNCERTAIN]
     We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar.
     So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States.
     And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee.
     So we're very confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the Solar Retrofit or Solar Roof.
     Our Solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average.
     After the Federal Tax Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt.
     And it's very simple, highly automated single-click experience.
>>> So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing roof either way, we're the company to go to.
     And then you also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility.
     So I think that product is really coming together and it's only going to get better later this year.
     So just very excited about that business potential.
     On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range.
     So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles.
     I mean, you basically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrive.
     And this is at highway speed.
