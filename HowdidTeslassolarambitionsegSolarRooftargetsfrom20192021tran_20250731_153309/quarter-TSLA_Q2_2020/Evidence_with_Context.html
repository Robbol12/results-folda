deployments through <span class="r3">2023</span>–<span class="r3">2024</span>?

    We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar.
    So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States.
    And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee.
    So we&#x27;re very confident that people will have our solar product, whether it&#x27;s the Solar Retrofit or Solar Roof.
    Our Solar is now <span class="r3">30</span>% cheaper than the U.S. average.
    After the Federal Tax Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $<span class="r3">1.49</span> per watt.
    And it&#x27;s very simple, highly automated single-click experience.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing</span>
<span class="r6">roof either way, we&#x27;re the company to go to.</span>
    And then you also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility.
    So I think that product is really coming together and it&#x27;s only going to get better later this year.
    So just very excited about that business potential.
    On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than <span class="r3">400</span> miles range.
    So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of <span class="r3">402</span> miles.
    I mean, you basically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you 
arrive.
    And this is at highway speed.

    Well, I&#x27;m sure they have lots of questions.
    We&#x27;ve already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
    So it&#x27;s already underway, started this weekend.
