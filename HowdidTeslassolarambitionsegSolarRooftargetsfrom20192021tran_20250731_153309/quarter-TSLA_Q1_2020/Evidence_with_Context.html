    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.

    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?

    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
    So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the
next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.

    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted</span>
<span class="r5">overall profitability.</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both 
from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r3">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5"> years?</span>
    This would be <span class="r3">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2025</span> and more than <span class="r3">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r3">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r3">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r3">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r3">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r3">3</span>.

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.

    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new </span>
<span class="r5">Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…</span>

<span class="r5">Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">New technologies.</span>

    Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span class="r3">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and
most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
