Yes.
    I&#x27;m Carl, I&#x27;m on the Solar Roof engineering and installation.
    The biggest constraint right now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and 
experienced.
    We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we&#x27;re continuing to hire.
    The next opportunity is improving the material flow on the job site.
    We&#x27;ve talked about this a lot in the factory as well that setting up the right packaging, kitting so that every 
installer on the roof has the parts they need at their fingertips.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, we&#x27;ve had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they&#x27;re ramping up installations for Solar </span>
<span class="r6">Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of future growth.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you, Carl.
    Elon Musk

I mean, here&#x27;s the way to think about that product, in my opinion.
    You have to say, I think what do you want the world to look like?
    When you look around the neighborhood future, decade from now, what do you want?
    What products are going to make your life better?
    What future do you want?
    And I think a future where we&#x27;ve got beautiful roofs with generating energy that are tough and resilient and better 
in every way than a regular roof and a lab with energy.

    We have a very large backlog of PowerWall orders and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer 
orders.
    We&#x27;re just now capturing the full power of customer-cited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions are 
providing services back to the grid when they don&#x27;t need to consume energy or have backup power.
    This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r3">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation </span>
<span class="r6">process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.</span>
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

purchases to upgraded hardware?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We&#x27;ll give it some thought.

    And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as a conglomerate of start-ups.
    Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be the most valuable business units within Tesla 
over the next five to seven years?
    Could you envision any of them ever spinning out from Tesla?
    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I think about this today.
    Tesla there&#x27;s probably in excess of a dozen startups effectively in Tesla.
