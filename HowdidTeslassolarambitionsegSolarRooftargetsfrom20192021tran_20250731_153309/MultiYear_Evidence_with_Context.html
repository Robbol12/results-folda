    So -- and it&#x27;s not just a question of money.
    It&#x27;s a question of will.
    Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it?
    So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation
of the past.
    If this was <span class="r3">1920</span>, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
    Obviously that’s not steam engines.
    So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people&#x27;s rights, as what
is happening right now.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if </span>
<span class="r6">somebody wants to stay in their house, that&#x27;s great.</span>
    They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
    But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
    This is not democratic.
    This is not freedom.
    Give people back their goddamn freedom.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
    The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think 
is great.
    The other one that I would add is, it&#x27;s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make 
that as digital as possible.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Touchless delivery.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car 
and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
    That&#x27;s it.
    Effortless.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And many customers do that.
    Elon Musk

And they&#x27;re doing it, yes.
    In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because 
normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.

    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r6">3</span>
<span class="r6">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r3">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.

    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.

    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.</span>
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r3">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.

normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
    When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, 
then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or 
something on Amazon and -- except it&#x27;s a car.
    Yes.
    All right.
    And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in <span class="r3">90</span> seconds, so.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally 
highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and time line for introduction?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yes.</span>
    Actually, we were just -- we don&#x27;t want to preempt Battery Day.
    We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell.
    And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla&#x27;s history and we&#x27;re just trying to figure out the 
right timing for that.
    We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.
    Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that&#x27;s the right timing.
    And depending upon what we&#x27;re allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.

    Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is <span class="r3">400</span> miles, but when we did the last EPA 
test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span class="r3">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span class="r3">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r3">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r3">400</span> miles.

    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies</span>
<span class="r6">in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond </span><span class="r6">1</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> a week.</span>
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?

    And so, currently, in North America, it&#x27;s sold for $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> as an option.
    We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue.
    That&#x27;s associated with features that will be released with time.
    Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
    It&#x27;s a little bit over $<span class="r3">600</span> million.
    And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been 
released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
    And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.</span>
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.

    Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
    Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is 
already positive at such low volume.
    How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model <span class="r3">3</span>, what other factors should we think about?
    And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.</span>
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r3">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r3">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r4">14</span><span class="r4">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r4">153</span><span class="r4">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r3">[PLAN]</span>
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r3">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.</span>
    Anything you guys want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
    The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think 
is great.

    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
    So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the
next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard
to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice.
    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit </span><span class="r6">1</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.</span>

    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted</span>
<span class="r6">overall profitability.</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally

    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.

    How many are you currently able to install per week?
    What is your installations per week target for the end of <span class="r3">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

We were actually gaining interest momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVID essentially shut us down, both 
from the ability to install and the ability to get permits.
    The permit offices were closed.
    And we&#x27;re sheltering places, <span class="r3">11</span> places.
    So we obviously cannot install and the – if you can&#x27;t get permits, then you can&#x27;t physically do it.
    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the</span>
<span class="r6">next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of </span><span class="r6">1</span><span class="r6">,</span><span class="r6">000</span><span class="r6"> a week.</span>
    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard
to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice.
    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.
    We actually have demonstrated the ability to hit <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week plus build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already.
    So that&#x27;s not a problem.
    It&#x27;s building out the installed teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industry 
installers.
    And internally, we want to have at least <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> Solar Roof install teams with – and taking a week or perhaps a little
less than a week to do an install, which gets you <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week roof installations.
    We see demand is good.

    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
    But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Anything you guys want to add?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
    The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think 
is great.
    The other one that I would add is, it&#x27;s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make 
that as digital as possible.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Touchless delivery.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
    Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.

And they&#x27;re doing it, yes.
    In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because 
normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
    Actually, my dentist is very -- but it&#x27;s really like quite an arduous thing.
    When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, 
then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or 
something on Amazon and -- except it&#x27;s a car.
    Yes.
    All right.
    And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in <span class="r3">90</span> seconds, so.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Actually, we were just -- we don&#x27;t want to preempt Battery Day.
    We want to leave the exciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell.
    And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla&#x27;s history and we&#x27;re just trying to figure out the 
right timing for that.
    We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.
    Not giving a firm date, but we think that probably that&#x27;s the right timing.
    And depending upon what we&#x27;re allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r3">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span class="r6">10</span><span class="r6"> years?</span>
    This would be <span class="r3">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2025</span> and more than <span class="r3">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r3">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r3">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r3">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r3">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r3">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r3">3</span>.

    It&#x27;s basically impossible.
    So – but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I&#x27;m confident that, let&#x27;s say, within the
next, I don&#x27;t know, year or—maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    That&#x27;s not in the middle of winter or something, like taking seasonality – allowing for seasonality, where it&#x27;s hard

    But like, say spring, I think it&#x27;s installing, which is the hard part.

    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r3">1</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> a week.
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.

    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r3">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r3">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.</span>
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.

Okay.
    And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progress stores development and 
commercialization of Full Self-Driving?
    How much revenue have you recognized so far?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So there is a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving.
    And so, currently, in North America, it&#x27;s sold for $<span class="r3">7</span>,<span class="r3">000</span> as an option.
    We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of it goes into deferred revenue.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s associated with features that will be released with time.</span>
    Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
    It&#x27;s a little bit over $<span class="r3">600</span> million.
    And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been 
released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
    And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
    So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.
