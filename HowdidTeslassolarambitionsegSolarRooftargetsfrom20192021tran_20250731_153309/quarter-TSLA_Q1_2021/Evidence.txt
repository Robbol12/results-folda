[TSLA_Q1_2021] How did Tesla’s solar ambitions (e.g., Solar Roof targets from 2019–2021) translate into actual deployments through 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #100]  This was driven by **Solar** **Roof**-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.
2. [Sentence #160]  The recent price changes on **Solar** **Roof** have been a bit discouraging for customers and investors.
3. [Sentence #161]  Could Tesla share more about **Solar** **Roof** challenges and if the outlook has changed at all, i.e.
4. [Sentence #164]  First of all, I should say, the demand for the **Solar** **Roof** remains strong.
5. [Sentence #165]  So despite raising the price, the demand is still significantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install the **Solar** Roofs.
6. [Sentence #170]  If a **roof** has a lot of protuberances or if the **roof** sort of the core structure of the **roof** is rotted out or is not strong enough to hold the **Solar** **Roof**, then the cost can be double, sometimes three times what our initial quotes were.
7. [Sentence #174]  But what is I think most important about the **Solar** **Roof** situation, which I tweeted about this past week, is that we are shifting the whole **solar** situation, the **solar** power, basically the **solar** factory situation to, there’s only one product basically, there’s only one configuration every house, but we will not sell a house **solar** without a Powerwall.
8. [Sentence #175]  That **solar** could either be **solar** retrofit with conventional panels put on the **roof** or it can be the Tesla **Solar** Glass **Roof**.
9. [Sentence #181]  And all installations will have a Powerwall and the difficult the installation will dramatically increase -- or the difficulty of the installation will be much less, it will be much easier, because the power from the **Solar** **Roof**, the **Solar** Glass **Roof**, or the **solar** panels, will only ever go directly into the Powerwall.
10. [Sentence #430]  So I understand like the negative gross margin with **Solar** **Roof** ran.
