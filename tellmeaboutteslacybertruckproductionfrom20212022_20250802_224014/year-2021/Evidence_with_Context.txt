[Year 2021] tell me about tesla cybertruck production from 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #1863, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.

2. [Sentence #1658, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
     So, that's a good result.
     But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
     So, if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
     And the same is true of this year.
     So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
     It would not make any sense because we'll still be part constrained.
>>> We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
     That is most likely.
     But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
     So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
     This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
     If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
     Capital equipment is distilled labor.
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?

     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.

4. [Sentence #1138, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
     As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
     As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
     Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
     As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
     Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.
     And so, you can extrapolate that out.
     There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.
     There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.
     But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
-----
5. [Sentence #1117, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
     I think Zach spoke to that well.
     And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
     We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.
     While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
>>> As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
     And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
     Lars Moravy

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
     This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
     In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
     If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.
-----
6. [Sentence #1286, TSLA_Q3_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
     Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
>>> We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
     As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
     And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
     There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.
     We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.
     Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

7. [Sentence #76, TSLA_Q1_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
     And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
>>> In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
-----
8. [Sentence #24, TSLA_Q1_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
     Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
     We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
     So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
     So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
     In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
     The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
>>> It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
     For Model 3 to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
     In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
     When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year.
     So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
     I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
     Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
     This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever existed.
-----
9. [Sentence #2035, TSLA_Q4_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
     You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
     That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
     And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
>>> If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
     If an asset has 5 times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.
     So, if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because still you don't want to drive.
     So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
     So, it's probably better than 5 times, I don't know.
     Yes.
-----
10. [Sentence #355, TSLA_Q1_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
     Prototypes are trivial.
     They are child’s play.
     Production is hard.
     It is very hard.
     Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low-cost, insanely difficult.
     But what Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
>>> The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.
     So this is -- this -- basically myself and NIO and Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
     It was so hard.
     You have no idea.
     So anyway, and the thing about making a large complex manufactured object is let’s say that you have a closer approximation 10,000 unique items.
     If even one of those items is slow, that sets your rate, just one.
     Isn’t that so trivial?
     We have had a production stop because of carpet in the trunk.

     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?

14. [Sentence #93, TSLA_Q1_2021] [PLAN]
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
     First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
     For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition.
     And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
     Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities.
>>> While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
     We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
     If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
     This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
     So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
     On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb fixed overheads.
     On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
     This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.

     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
>>> So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
     And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year, we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year.
     This level of growth didn't happen by coincidence.
     It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.
     Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin.
     Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
     This is a critical milestone for the Company.
     So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.

Thank you very much.
     And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Very good quarter.
     I had two quick questions.
     First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
     Who are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
>>> And the second question is related to Cybertruck.
     Who is the supply looking at?
     If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for Cybertruck?
     That's all for me.
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     Sure.
     So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
     With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.

Yes, thanks, Martin.
     Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.
     Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
     However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
     Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
     And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.

     So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
     And so, this already does exist.
     And not directly in the form here.
     And we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in as a result.
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.

     So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
     And so, this already does exist.
     And not directly in the form here.
     And we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in as a result.
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
>>> Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
     We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
     As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
     And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
     There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.

     They will have to increase the size of the substations.
     It’s a nightmare.
     This must occur.
     There must be solar plus battery.
     It’s the only way.
     So, yeah.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> And the next retail question is, Master of Coin, can you tell us anything about Tesla’s future plans in digital currency space?
     Or when any such major developments might be revealed?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     Thanks, Martin.
     So as I noted in our opening remarks and we have announced previously, so Tesla did invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin in Q1 and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that.
     We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using Bitcoin.
     And so where our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here.
     Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn’t being immediately used, trying to get some level of return on this but also preserve liquidity.

     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you very much.
     Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today.
     Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening, and we will speak to you again in about three months.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Thanks.
     Thanks, everyone.
