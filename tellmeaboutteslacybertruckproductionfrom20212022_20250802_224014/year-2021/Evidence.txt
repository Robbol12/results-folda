Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla First Quarter 2021 Results and Q&A Webcast.
7. [Sentence #1110]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] of the $25,000 model in 2023.
8. [Sentence #1117]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow].
9. [Sentence #1138]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
10. [Sentence #1281]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
11. [Sentence #1282]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Will you show off the new and improved [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow]?
12. [Sentence #1286]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) We've been busy detailing the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
13. [Sentence #1549]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And the second question is related to [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow].
14. [Sentence #1613]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
15. [Sentence #1658]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow], Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] hopefully next year.
16. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] volume [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] besides battery shortage?
17. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow].
18. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] that will take some time to work through.
19. [Sentence #1869]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I worry more about like how do we the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] affordable despite having awesome technology.
20. [Sentence #1871]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
21. [Sentence #2034]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And I think you made reference to [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
22. [Sentence #2035]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
