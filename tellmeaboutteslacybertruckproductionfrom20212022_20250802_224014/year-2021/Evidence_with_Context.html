    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?</span>
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.

    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
    But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same 
because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
    So, if we&#x27;d actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on
that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
    And the same is true of this year.
    So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
    It would not make any sense because we&#x27;ll still be part constrained.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.</span>
    That is most likely.
    But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
    So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we&#x27;re doing this year 
is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
    This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
    If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
    Capital equipment is distilled labor.
    So, what happens if you don&#x27;t actually have a labor shortage?

on the order of  vehicles a year.

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.

    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
    And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other </span>

    So Q1 <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">factories.</span>
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
    You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year or better.
    That would put you at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.2</span> million vehicles or more in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.

Yes.
    I mean, it&#x27;s apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
    If an asset has <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times more utilization than the -- it&#x27;s like dividing the cost of that asset by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>.

still you don&#x27;t want to drive.
    So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.

    I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
    Prototypes are trivial.
    They are child’s play.
    Production is hard.
    It is very hard.
    Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low-cost, insanely difficult.
    But what Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production of a car in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years and not go bankrupt.</span>
    So this is -- this -- basically myself and NIO and Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
    It was so hard.
    You have no idea.
    So anyway, and the thing about making a large complex manufactured object is let’s say that you have a closer 
approximation <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> unique items.
    If even one of those items is slow, that sets your rate, just one.
    Isn’t that so trivial?
    We have had a production stop because of carpet in the trunk.

    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.</span>
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?

    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
    First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the 
first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.</span>
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
    If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
    This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure 
as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
    So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as 
some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
    On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the
used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb 
fixed overheads.
    On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
    This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.

volumes by nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% last year.
    This level of growth didn&#x27;t happen by coincidence.
    It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.
    Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>% GAAP operating margin.
    Lastly, thanks to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span> billion of GAAP net income in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the 
Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
    This is a critical milestone for the Company.
    So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Very good quarter.
    I had two quick questions.
    First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
    Who are the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is related to Cybertruck.</span>
    Who is the supply looking at?
    If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I&#x27;ll say in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">23</span>-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span> time for Cybertruck?
    That&#x27;s all for me.
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    Sure.
    So obviously, as we&#x27;ve noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to 
meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
    With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on 
track to be complete this quarter.
    Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
    However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
    Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
    And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the 
pack timeline I just mentioned.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">25</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> model </span>

    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">18</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and we know there are a lot of updates.</span>
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.

    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">on the order of  vehicles a year.</span>
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.

    They will have to increase the size of the substations.
    It’s a nightmare.
    This must occur.
    There must be solar plus battery.
    It’s the only way.
    So, yeah.

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next retail question is, Master of Coin, can you tell us anything about Tesla’s future plans in digital </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">currency space?</span>
    Or when any such major developments might be revealed?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    Thanks, Martin.
    So as I noted in our opening remarks and we have announced previously, so Tesla did invest $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> billion into Bitcoin
in Q1 and then we subsequently sold a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% stake in that.
    We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using Bitcoin.
    And so where our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here.
    Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn’t being immediately used, trying to get some level of 
return on this but also preserve liquidity.
