[TSLA_Q3_2022] tell me about tesla cybertruck production from 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #165] [PLAN]
     Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
     Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
     When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.

2. [Sentence #132] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
-----
3. [Sentence #182] [PLAN]
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
>>> And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.

4. [Sentence #509] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Before incentive.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
     We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?
-----
5. [Sentence #180] [PLAN]
     Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
     That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
>>> So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
     And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.

6. [Sentence #167] [PLAN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

7. [Sentence #218] [UNCERTAIN]
     On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
     And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
     Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
     Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.

8. [Sentence #83] [UNCERTAIN]
     You’re the ones making it happen.
     Thank you.
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
>>> Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
     Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.

9. [Sentence #200] [PLAN]
     And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
     I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
     It’s not a number.
     It’s [indiscernible] table.
     You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
     And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
     As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
>>> So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.
     And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
     And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
     So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?
     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?
-----
10. [Sentence #258] [UNCERTAIN]
     And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold.
     When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
     And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
     Elon Musk

Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously.
     At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
     So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
     It will be smaller, to be clear.
>>> But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
     I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.
     But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.
     So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.
     It’s like, we’re going to take two.
     That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Effort costs.
