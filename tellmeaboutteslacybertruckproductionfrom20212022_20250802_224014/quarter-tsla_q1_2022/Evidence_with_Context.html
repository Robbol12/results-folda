    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in

    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.

    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
    Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating 
margin of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>%.
    This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
    So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many 
difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
    They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a 
tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
    And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% growth in vehicle production in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> versus ‘</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">21</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>% increase over last year.
    So, let’s see.
    Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">261</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000">SCALE ACHIEVED</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    So there’s actually <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>.
    So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re 
going to be waiting forever.
    If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than 
the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
    When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
    Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
    Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">aiming for volume production in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production at Fremont and 
at Giga Texas?
    What do you expect run rates of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
    Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack.
    So, they’re not constrained by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    They will transition to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
    We also have, just as a risk mitigation, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2170</span> nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">own conclusions on progress being made?</span>
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.

    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.</span>
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
