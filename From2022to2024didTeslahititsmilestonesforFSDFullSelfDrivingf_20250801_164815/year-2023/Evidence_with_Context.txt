[Year 2023] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #1151, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PILOT]
     I mean, like we’re asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer.
     So, let’s move on.
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today.
     So, we’ll speak to you all in the next three months.
     Thank you very much.
     Elon Musk

--- TSLA_Q3_2023 ---
Elon Musk

[Call Starts Abruptly]…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
>>> Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
     We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s.
     We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
     We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12.
     This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
     Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

2. [Sentence #1308, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PILOT]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
     Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
     Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
     So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
     Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
>>> Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?
     And if so, when?
     Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
     We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
     Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
     It must have a lead car in plains, only 40 miles per hour.
     Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
     But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.
-----
3. [Sentence #1001, TSLA_Q2_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today.
     Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week.
     If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish.
     If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
     Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
     The value is just tremendous.
     So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
>>> I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next analyst.
     The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
     First, following up on the autonomy.
     So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD incrementally.
     What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates?

     What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates?
>>> And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?
     Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
     The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
     So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
     And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
     But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves.
     Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
     That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.
-----
5. [Sentence #652, TSLA_Q2_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Some other highlights.
     Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations.
     As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the North American Charging Standard.
     We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network.
     We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general.
     So, that’s the goal there.
     Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies.
>>> And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
     So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
     We’re more than happy to license it to others.
     And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
     Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to come.
     Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
     And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.

6. [Sentence #226, TSLA_Q1_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.
     Go ahead and unmute.
     George Gianarikas

Hi.
     Thanks for taking my question.
     I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there?
     And also, given that you've reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
     So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
     And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
     And it's really -- yes.
     I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
     There'll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
     But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
     And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year.
-----
7. [Sentence #40, TSLA_Q1_2023] [PILOT]
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
     Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.
     This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
     And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
     There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year.
     And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
     So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
>>> Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
     We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
     Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.
     So, yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy.
     So, we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
     And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
     So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
     In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
-----
8. [Sentence #753, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place.
     But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
     And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.
     We’re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly [Indiscernible] to kind of extend some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade.
     So it’s a playbook that we’ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question on FSD.
>>> Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     This is a question we get asked a lot.
     So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
     This is a onetime amnesty.
     So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames.
     So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
     This is a onetime thing.
-----
9. [Sentence #1672, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.
     This brings us to 2024.
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
     Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
     We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
>>> For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions.
     This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
     So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
     This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
     That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.
     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
     It's really quite remarkable.
-----
10. [Sentence #1671, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.

     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
-----
11. [Sentence #630, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PILOT]
     And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data.
     So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training.
     It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
     So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is just enormous.
     So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
     But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
     And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a 100 exaflops by the end of next year.
>>> So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
     That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
     It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
     And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
     We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so.
     And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it’s really dedicated.
     It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development.
     With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin.
-----
12. [Sentence #1675, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     This brings us to 2024.
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
     Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.

     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
     It's really quite remarkable.
     Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
     Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old.
     So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.

     Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.
     So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.
     But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
     And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.
     And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level.
>>> So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.
     And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way.
     When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week.
     That’s -- if you drive 1.5-hour a day on average, that’s roughly 10 hours a week out of 168 hours.
     And then there’s also you’re going to have parking and insurance.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks Martin.
     As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our energy and services and other businesses.
     Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
     As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
     First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business.
>>> This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend.
     This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
     Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments.
     This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
     If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
     We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories.
     For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack.
     As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones.

     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
     And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
>>> Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
     And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet.
     I think that will become obvious probably this year.
     And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
     It's definitely the smart move.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from Siddharth.
     What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting there?

     And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
     Some other highlights.
     Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations.
     As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the North American Charging Standard.
     We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network.
     We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general.
     So, that’s the goal there.
>>> Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies.
     And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
     So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
     We’re more than happy to license it to others.
     And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
     Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to come.
     Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter.

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.
     Go ahead and unmute.
     George Gianarikas

Hi.
     Thanks for taking my question.
     I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there?
>>> And also, given that you've reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
     So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
     And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
     And it's really -- yes.
     I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
     There'll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
