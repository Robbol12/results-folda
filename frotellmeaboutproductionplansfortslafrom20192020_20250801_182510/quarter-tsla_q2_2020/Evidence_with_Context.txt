[TSLA_Q2_2020] frotell me about production plans for tsla from 2019-2020

1. [Sentence #321] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     That's the real limit.
     So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint.
     And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
     So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
     And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
     And there's a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.

Thank you.
>>> And the second question is, now that it's time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more detail on production plans?
     What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
     And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So we'll start production next year, as we announced it before.
     I'm personally very excited about the project.
     I can't wait.
     We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
