[TSLA_Q4_2020] frotell me about production plans for tsla from 2019-2020

1. [Sentence #328] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We've got the designs fixed.
     We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
     We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
     So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.
     So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
     8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
     And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
>>> If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
