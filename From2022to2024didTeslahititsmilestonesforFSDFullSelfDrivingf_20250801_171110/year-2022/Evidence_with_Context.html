    Elon Musk

There is always a lot of uncertainty like the production looks like ESCO , and that intermediate part of ESCO, it’s very
difficult to bridge that with high certainty.
    But the end part of the ESCO, you can say, I think you can have a lot more certainty.
    And so that’s why I am confident we will get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at – in Austin and Berlin by the end of this year

    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy around FSD, and as you get closer to this full functionality </span>

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We will increase the price of FSD sometime later this year.
    I think probably just before we go to quiet Beta or Beta is anyone who wants to use the Beta software with all the 
caveats associated with that can use it.
    Then it would make sense to increase the price of FSD.
    The value of FSD is, I think extremely high and not well understood by most people.
    It is basically currently ridiculously cheap, assuming FSD materializes, which is well.
    Colin Rusch

Great.

    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
    So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">this year, probably about a month from now.</span>
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
    Let’s see, with respect to demand.
    We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
    I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far 
into future as we can see.
    So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins 
strong.
    We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1902</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And so there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which 
Zach alluded to, which is that, just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the 
other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.
    So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost of insurance costs even when they don&#x27;t use 
Tesla Insurance, because now the guy  goes up to the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous 
insurance for Teslas.
    So it&#x27;s great.
    So it has an amplified effect, very important.
    Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas 
worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it&#x27;s in a collision and for Tesla 
Insurance.
    And previously, we didn&#x27;t actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover 
the cost.
    And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;ve actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.</span>
    So it&#x27;s giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just 
figuring out how to get -- if somebody&#x27;s cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
    They&#x27;re like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
    But we&#x27;re actually solving how to get somebody&#x27;s car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
    And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">100</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.</span>
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
    And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?

    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell.
    And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant 
portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.

    I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year.
    Is that still possible?
    Is it -- would it still be like a Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> or Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> that you’re talking about?

We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by

    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
    We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at
a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% or greater compound annual growth rate.
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.

    This, I guess, for Zach.
    Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on 
every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
    But was wondering if you&#x27;re able to disclose the percentage of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> price that you&#x27;re not going to be able to
recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, the way that we&#x27;ve structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
    There&#x27;s enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
    We fully recognize that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we&#x27;ve released a </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">portion of that.</span>
    And then there&#x27;s a minority of the total package that&#x27;s remaining that will be released over time as software 
updates are there.
    And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also 
included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with 
future software updates.
    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    And then maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you&#x27;re planning.
    That&#x27;s a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won&#x27;t be putting all of those in Tesla Semi.
    So I guess, two questions about that incremental capacity.
    First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your 
entire range of products?

    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.</span>
    So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program 
this year, probably about a month from now.
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
    Let’s see, with respect to demand.
    We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
    I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far 
into future as we can see.
    So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins 
strong.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1823</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
    As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we&#x27;re delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been
so long for so much of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
    The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we&#x27;re most focused on what our operating
margin is.
    And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing 
faster than the vehicle business and as we&#x27;re heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our 
overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
    And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we&#x27;re 
primarily managing to now.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don&#x27;t is </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.</span>
    So that&#x27;s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a 
small percentage of cars don&#x27;t have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So that means that there&#x27;s millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% gross margin.
    And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
    And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
    That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
    Yeah.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
    We love his optimism for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their 
own conclusions on progress being made?
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">self-driving.</span>
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
    The best way to reach your own assessment is to join the Tesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> people right now enrolled in that program, and we expect to broaden that significantly this year.
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Thank you.
    And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
    William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success
in each of the three major AI endeavors.
    FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
    Elon Musk

We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there.
    And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our 
control.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">improvement.</span>
    You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
    In fact, we almost are there.
    And so, we’re probably -- achieving that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA 
continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs.
    So the jury is out on Dojo.
    Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn&#x27;t, 
that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
    So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
    I&#x27;m just guessing here.
    So, this is -- that would be my guess.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thank you, so much.
    So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared
to a year ago, it&#x27;s -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout.
    And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">400</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cars </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">take rate?</span>
    Elon Musk

The trend is very strong towards use of FSD.
    And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases.
    And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don&#x27;t quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course 
say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world&#x27;s leading 
AI companies.
    This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
    With the Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at 
this point, five years old from the design point.
    And Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> coming and then Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> beyond that, where there are significant leaps.
    And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Will this be a v11 or later version?
    If the latter, can you explain what makes it a difficult problem in layman terms?
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    This answer will be understood by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.0</span> -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">01</span>% of the audience, I think.
    I suppose you wanted to know what a unified vector space would actually mean.
    It essentially would be if you can take – if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they 
could be net together at the neural net level, then you don’t need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.
    That is an architecturally better way to – that’s the most desirable outcome.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s – I think it’s probably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in the</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">efficiency of the self-driving.</span>
    And it’s certainly something we want to get to.
    Yes.
    The sort of nirvana situation is you have surround video/audio labeling of all static and dynamic objects.
    And you have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well.
    Then that’s – I mean, I think we are almost certainly there before the end of the year.
    Yes, I am not sure how many of you would understand that.
    I should say also, we are also confident of improving the frame rate as we delete some of the legacy neural nets.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">400</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">customers in North America.</span>
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells by another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.

the year.
    So we are not dependent on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> will be important next year but it is not important for this year.
    That said we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas.
    And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expand capacity.
    Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD beta with City Streets driving capability to over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> owners.
    They are very happy with the capability of the system and we will continue to improve it every week.

    That’s more autonomous miles than any company we are aware of, I think probably more than – it might be more than 
any – all other companies combined.
    So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
    With regard to manufacturing and technology, about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> years ago, we said we wanted to become the best 
manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our 
strongest competitive advantage.
    We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
    And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.
    And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do.
    We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that’s manufacturing.

    But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of 
improvement.
    You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
    In fact, we almost are there.
    And so, we’re probably -- achieving that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.
    The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>%.

    Martin Viecha

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes

Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    So a quick one on FSD.
    This, I guess, for Zach.
    Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on 
every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
    But was wondering if you&#x27;re able to disclose the percentage of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> price that you&#x27;re not going to be able to
recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, the way that we&#x27;ve structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.</span>
    There&#x27;s enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
    We fully recognize that.
    Then there&#x27;s an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we&#x27;ve released a 
portion of that.
    And then there&#x27;s a minority of the total package that&#x27;s remaining that will be released over time as software 
updates are there.
    And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also 
included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with 
future software updates.
    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    And then maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you&#x27;re planning.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">400</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> 
customers in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">AI-powered autonomy.</span>
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells by another <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Our production of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell.
    And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant 
portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our vehicles have now driven nearly </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">60</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">exponentially.</span>
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
    So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
    So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program 
this year, probably about a month from now.
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
