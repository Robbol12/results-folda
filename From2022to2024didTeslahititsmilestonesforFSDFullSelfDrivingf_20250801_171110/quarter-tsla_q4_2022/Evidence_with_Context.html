<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And so there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which 
Zach alluded to, which is that, just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the 
other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.
    So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost of insurance costs even when they don&#x27;t use 
Tesla Insurance, because now the guy  goes up to the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous 
insurance for Teslas.
    So it&#x27;s great.
    So it has an amplified effect, very important.
    Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas 
worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it&#x27;s in a collision and for Tesla 
Insurance.
    And previously, we didn&#x27;t actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover 
the cost.
    And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;ve actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.</span>
    So it&#x27;s giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just 
figuring out how to get -- if somebody&#x27;s cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
    They&#x27;re like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
    But we&#x27;re actually solving how to get somebody&#x27;s car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
    And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.

    This, I guess, for Zach.
    Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on 
every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD.
    But was wondering if you&#x27;re able to disclose the percentage of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> price that you&#x27;re not going to be able to
recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, the way that we&#x27;ve structured this is a full self-driving package has two components.
    There&#x27;s enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website.
    We fully recognize that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we&#x27;ve released a </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">portion of that.</span>
    And then there&#x27;s a minority of the total package that&#x27;s remaining that will be released over time as software 
updates are there.
    And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also 
included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with 
future software updates.
    Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    And then maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you&#x27;re planning.
    That&#x27;s a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won&#x27;t be putting all of those in Tesla Semi.
    So I guess, two questions about that incremental capacity.
    First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your 
entire range of products?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">140</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
    As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we&#x27;re delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been
so long for so much of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
    The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we&#x27;re most focused on what our operating
margin is.
    And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing 
faster than the vehicle business and as we&#x27;re heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our 
overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
    And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we&#x27;re 
primarily managing to now.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don&#x27;t is </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.</span>
    So that&#x27;s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a 
small percentage of cars don&#x27;t have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So that means that there&#x27;s millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% gross margin.
    And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
    And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.
    That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.
    Yeah.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.

    My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn&#x27;t, 
that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
    So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
    I&#x27;m just guessing here.
    So, this is -- that would be my guess.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thank you, so much.
    So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared
to a year ago, it&#x27;s -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout.
    And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">400</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> cars </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">take rate?</span>
    Elon Musk

The trend is very strong towards use of FSD.
    And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases.
    And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don&#x27;t quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course 
say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world&#x27;s leading 
AI companies.
    This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
    With the Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at 
this point, five years old from the design point.
    And Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> coming and then Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> beyond that, where there are significant leaps.
    And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">400</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">,</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">000</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">customers in North America.</span>
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re
