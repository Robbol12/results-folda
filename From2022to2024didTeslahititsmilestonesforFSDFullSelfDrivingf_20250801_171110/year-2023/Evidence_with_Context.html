<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Call Starts Abruptly<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and that number is growing rapidly.</span>
    We recently completed a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> GPU cluster of H100s.
    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
    Elon Musk

Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it.
    Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value.
    So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is again on FSD.
    Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> autonomous driving system drive pilot is active.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD?</span>
    And if so, when?
    Elon Musk

Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits.
    We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some 
certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog.
    It must have a lead car in plains, only <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> miles per hour.
    Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach.
    But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?

    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.
    Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.
    That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators.

    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> -- roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> connectors and over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
    Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just 
as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just 
making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car 
companies.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.</span>
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.

    Let&#x27;s go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.
    Go ahead and unmute.
    George Gianarikas

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term 
contracts we have in place.
    But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such 
as nickel, cobalt and graphite.
    And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.
    We’re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> to kind of extend 
some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade.
    So it’s a playbook that we’ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question on FSD.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This is a question we get asked a lot.
    So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
    This is a onetime amnesty.
    So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within 
reasonable delivery time frames.
    So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
    This is a onetime thing.

    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
    Free cash flow remains strong at $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, in spite of record spending on future projects.
    So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&amp;D.
    This brings us to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full 
self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.

    And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our 
computer, if they did not have the training data.
    So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net 
training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
    And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> exaflops by the end of next year.

    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.

Elon Musk

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Call Starts Abruptly<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there.
    Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving 
beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
    We recently completed a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> GPU cluster of H100s.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.</span>
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
    I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by 
regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">incrementally.</span>
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?
    And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions 
about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past.
    The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version 
of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically.
    So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up.
    And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing.
    But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic
curves.

    Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption.
    So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing.
    But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to 
necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where 
the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
    And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service.
    And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a 
very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.</span>
    And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD 
over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly 
astounding in a positive way.
    When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> hours of usage per week.
    That’s -- if you drive <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span>-hour a day on average, that’s roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week out of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">168</span> hours.

    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the 
value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.</span>
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.
    So that&#x27;s what it looks like.
    Yes.
    George Gianarikas

Thank you.
    Maybe on the dramatic change we&#x27;ve seen in EV-related commodity prices.
    Do you think it&#x27;s a reflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining, or is that sort of a coincident 
indicator on global EV demand?
    And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next several quarters?

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">R&amp;D spend.</span>
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.

    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So a much easier situation.
    And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly 
improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.</span>
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
    It&#x27;s definitely the smart move.

    The next question from Siddharth.
    What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting 
there?

    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> -- roughly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> connectors and over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">companies.</span>
    And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.
    Go ahead and unmute.

Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?</span>
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the 
value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
