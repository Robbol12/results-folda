I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.

    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.

    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.

    So, it&#x27;s really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
    But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car --
allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to
intervene or were little concerned.
    But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
    And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">full self-driving technology.</span>
    What we&#x27;ve generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
    And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference 
computer.
    That&#x27;s better than us selling CAD drawings.
    And then we&#x27;re only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the 
complexity.
    And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we 
obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
    I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that 
unless you have FSD, you&#x27;re dead.

    With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
    But I&#x27;m certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
    And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla&#x27;s software, yes.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thanks very much.
    And now we will move on to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when we look back on </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">or the Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> or Model Y.</span>
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.

    And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.
    And we&#x27;re also -- so that&#x27;s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>.
    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span> of FSD is going out soon.
    will elaborate more on that later in the call.
    We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>.
    And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three 
orders of magnitude.
    So, that&#x27;s a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it&#x27;s next -- it </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">seems extremely likely to be next year.</span>
    Ashok, do you want to say anything?
    Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
    Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 10<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> improvement with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> from 
starting of this year and then with v13 release.
    We expect to be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,00<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0x</span> from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
    And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also 
helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
    And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
    By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.

    Mark Delaney

Yes.
    Good afternoon.
    Thanks very much for taking the question.
    The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not 
really been believing in it.
    Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.
    And I think it is.
    I think we&#x27;ve now with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.3</span>, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a 
relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving.
    No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
    Vaibhav Taneja

No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.

    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
    This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- 
not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we&#x27;ve made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version</span>

    Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span> has 5x the parameters of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.4</span> and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.
    So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
    So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.5</span>, we are finally merged the two stacks.
    I still find that most people actually don&#x27;t know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand
the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
    One of the things we&#x27;re going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car 
is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them
around the block.
    Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
    So it&#x27;s very compelling.

Thanks so much.
    Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would 
decline by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% versus the current three and Y.

    Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
    It&#x27;s been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.

    The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
    Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
    It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, and maybe a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.6</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>

    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.

    The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
    Elon Musk

With respect to Roadster, we&#x27;ve completed most of the engineering.
    And I think there&#x27;s still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next 
year.
    It will be something special, like the whole thing <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>.
    Travis Axelrod

Fantastic.
    The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we&#x27;ve already covered.
    So we&#x27;ll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">self-driving.</span>
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
    I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
    So next year seems highly probable to me based on  <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span>ph<span style="font-weight: bold">)</span> plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
    That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.

    In fact, even $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> billion training compute in that situation will be quite a good deal.
    Yes, the future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that&#x27;s for sure.
    We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history.
    So, yes, so the proof is in the pudding.
    So, we&#x27;re going to be launching unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.
    So, I talked to the team.
    We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in 
Austin in June.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We already have Teslas operating autonomously unsupervised full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we&#x27;ll </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">soon be doing that at our factory in Texas.</span>
    So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California, that we&#x27;ll 
soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world, the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.
    And the cars aren&#x27;t just driving to exactly the same spot because, obviously, they want to collide at the same spot.
    The cars are actually programmed with where -- with what lane they need to park into to be picked up for delivery.
    So, the drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking spot and to be picked up for delivery to 
customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day.
    It&#x27;s pretty cool.
    Like I said, these Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them in June in Austin.
    So, what I&#x27;m saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation.

    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I&#x27;m making here are going to be pretty accurate.
    And it&#x27;s worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon&#x27;s always late.
    Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I&#x27;m late but never reports when I&#x27;m early.
    So, sure, I&#x27;m optimistic but I&#x27;m not that optimistic.
    There are many cases in past where actually we&#x27;ve been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the 
factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
    So, yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m very confident we&#x27;ll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">North America, at least.</span>
    I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it&#x27;s likely to be just regulatory.
    Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs 
to be addressed.
    This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
    So, guys, there&#x27;s too many reps in the field.
    For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we 
have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
    Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
    And there&#x27;s like this EU country committee.

    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.

    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in

    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup

    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect </span>

    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
    Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping 
Cybertruck and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished 
goods.
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.

    Alex Potter

Perfect.
    Thanks.
    I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing.
    You mentioned that in passing previously, was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that
would work.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">need, I don&#x27;t know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that&#x27;s based on FSD.</span>
    I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla&#x27;s electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack.
    So I, correct me if I&#x27;m sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with 
another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you&#x27;d be able to recognize licensing revenue from 
that agreement.
    Is that the right way to think about that?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The OEMs not real fast.
    There&#x27;s not really a sensor suite, it&#x27;s just cameras.
    But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">360</span> degree view.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Then as probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet.
    So, kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guestroom, add it to the Airbnb or
don&#x27;t add it to the Airbnb inventory.
    If you&#x27;re traveling for a month, you can or whatever the case maybe you can let other people use your house.
    And then you can -- so that&#x27;s probably next year because we want to just make sure we&#x27;ve ironed out any kinks.
    And a lot of it -- it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re not splitting atoms here.
    It&#x27;s just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works, especially that people can order
the car, it comes to the right spot, does exactly the right thing, all the payment systems work, the billing works.
    Yes.

    It&#x27;s super boring because I don&#x27;t really need to intervene anymore.
    And the really annoying thing is that I can&#x27;t just check my emails.
    And so, are you working also on introducing like a kind of like free unsupervised where I could be eyes off, and I 
would be able to check my email and would just need to, with a five-second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on

could expect for this year.
    It&#x27;s a very selfish question I ask for myself, to be honest.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given that V13 already covered to control?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, we&#x27;re going to have a whole let further than photons to output.
    We&#x27;ve been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but nets from photons to controls for a while now for 
just improving the neural nets.
    I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree.
    I have to say I continue to be amazed by just how effective auto-aggressive transformers are at solving a wide range

    As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro 
environment.
    We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
    For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who 
helped us achieve this.
    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
    While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the 
Greater China market.
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.</span>
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">35</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
    All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
    As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch 
but will be overcome as production is ramped.
    We will be introducing several new products throughout <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.

to full production.

    So, it&#x27;s really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
    But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car --
allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to
intervene or were little concerned.
    But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
    And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    What we&#x27;re seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla 
full self-driving technology.
    What we&#x27;ve generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
    And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference 
computer.
    That&#x27;s better than us selling CAD drawings.
    And then we&#x27;re only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth the 
complexity.
    And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we 
obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.

Hi, everyone.
    Thank you for taking my questions.
    Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second.
    And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal less, wheel less vehicle.
    And according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory 
environment.
    And from what we understand, and again, maybe I&#x27;m wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in 
images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn&#x27;t have pedal -- pedals or </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can&#x27;t make it work, not because the regulators, 
they&#x27;re blaming regulators.
    That&#x27;s misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.
    So it&#x27;s just that their technology is not far.
    George Gianarikas

Right.
    And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the 
price.

    So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make 
compelling EVs.
    So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.
    And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more 
difficult for Tesla.
    We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.
    And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully 
electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.

    Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.
    And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure 
to support future products.
    We won&#x27;t get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
    But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
    The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
    In addition to that, we&#x27;ve scale economies and we&#x27;re the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
    So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
