[Year 2024] From 2023 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #211, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
>>> The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
     Elon already talked about that.
     So we’ll have to wait till August.
     The following question is about the next-generation vehicle.
     We already talked about that.

2. [Sentence #806, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you.
     Just a couple more.
>>> Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
-----
3. [Sentence #693, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
     This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
     So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
     So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
     We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
     The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
     I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
>>> Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
     And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
     ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
     And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
     I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.

4. [Sentence #1972, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     So, it's really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
     But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car -- allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were little concerned.
     But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
     And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
>>> What we're seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla full self-driving technology.
     What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
     And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer.
     That's better than us selling CAD drawings.
     And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it's not worth the complexity.
     And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
     I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.

5. [Sentence #814, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
     And I suspect there will be more over time.
     But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
     Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.
>>> It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.
     With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment.
     But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
     And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thanks very much.
     And now we will move on to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
-----
6. [Sentence #1892, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as much demand as we can possibly make.
     So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation, and we're building a third factory.
     So, we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
     Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from 1 pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications?
     It can't go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
     But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time.
     So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
>>> And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y.
     In fact, I think it probably will be viewed '25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.
     There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
     I don't even know who's in second place.
     Like you say, like, who's in the second place for real-world AI?
     I would need a very big telescope to see them.
     That's how far behind they are.
     All right.
-----
7. [Sentence #1200, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     And the release of actually Smart -- we try to have a sense of humor here.
     And we're also -- so that's 12.5.
     Version 13 of FSD is going out soon.
     will elaborate more on that later in the call.
     We expect to see roughly a five- or sixfold improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5.
     And actually, looking at the year as whole, the improvement in miles interventions, we think will be at least three orders of magnitude.
     So, that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year, and we expect that trend to continue next year.
>>> So, the current total expectation, internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between versions than human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being in the third quarter, but it's next -- it seems extremely likely to be next year.
     Ashok, do you want to say anything?
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yeah.
     Miles between critical interventions, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made 100x improvement with 12.5 from starting of this year and then with v13 release.
     We expect to be 1,000x from the beginning, from January of this year on production software.
     And this came in because of technology improvements going to end to end, having higher frame rate, partly also helped by Hardware force, more capabilities, so on.
     And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
     By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.
-----
8. [Sentence #365, TSLA_Q1_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
     Mark please go ahead and unmute.
     Mark Delaney

Yes.
     Good afternoon.
     Thanks very much for taking the question.
     The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not really been believing in it.
     Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
>>> And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.
     And I think it is.
     I think we've now with 12.3, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving.
     No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
     Vaibhav Taneja

No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.
-----
9. [Sentence #665, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
     We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
     But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
     The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
     In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
     So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
     This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus.
>>> Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works.
     Version 12.5 has 5x the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks.
     So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
     So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks.
     I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
     One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block.
     Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
     So it's very compelling.
-----
10. [Sentence #573, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it.
     We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every carmaker on earth.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.
     Ben, go ahead and unmute.
     Ben, you're still muted.
>>> Elon Musk

Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FSD 12.3.
     It really – you can't – it's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     So since Ben is not unmuting.
     Let's try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research.
     Final question.
     Shreyas Patil

Thanks so much.
     Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS.

11. [Sentence #807, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you.
     Just a couple more.

12. [Sentence #2086, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously.
     People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
     So, we're not giving up on Hardware.
     We're still working on it.
     Just will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done.
     Now I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Elon.
     The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
     Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
     It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
-----
13. [Sentence #982, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     So it's -- there's this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human.
     We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
     It's difficult to argue with if you -- if you've got a large number of -- yes, if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
     What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
     They would -- they're morally obligated to approve.
     So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
     I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in, in North America.
>>> So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.
     And I, I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in those regions obviously.
     Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
     Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
     Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is the same across all 50 states.
     The road rules are the same across all 50 states.
     So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states, reasonably.
     Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation company or deploying taxes.
-----
14. [Sentence #748, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
     Elon Musk

With respect to Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering.
     And I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next year.
     It will be something special, like the whole thing [Indiscernible].
     Travis Axelrod

Fantastic.
     The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered.
     So we'll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
>>> Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving.
     It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
     So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
     I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
     So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
     That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
     Travis Axelrod

Thank you very much.
     Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
-----
15. [Sentence #1831, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     In fact, even $500 billion training compute in that situation will be quite a good deal.
     Yes, the future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure.
     We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history.
     So, yes, so the proof is in the pudding.
     So, we're going to be launching unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.
     So, I talked to the team.
     We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in Austin in June.
>>> We already have Teslas operating autonomously unsupervised full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we'll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas.
     So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California, that we'll soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world, the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.
     And the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because, obviously, they want to collide at the same spot.
     The cars are actually programmed with where -- with what lane they need to park into to be picked up for delivery.
     So, the drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking spot and to be picked up for delivery to customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day.
     It's pretty cool.
     Like I said, these Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them in June in Austin.
     So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation.
-----
16. [Sentence #2163, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, "Hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?"
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate.
     And it's worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon's always late.
     Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I'm late but never reports when I'm early.
     So, sure, I'm optimistic but I'm not that optimistic.
     There are many cases in past where actually we've been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
     So, yes.
>>> But I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in North America, at least.
     I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory.
     Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs to be addressed.
     This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
     So, guys, there's too many reps in the field.
     For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
     Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
     And there's like this EU country committee.

17. [Sentence #28, TSLA_Q1_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
     It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
     And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
     Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.
     It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America.
     So it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
>>> So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
     Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
     It's really how humans drive.
     Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
     So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
     To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out.
     And as we've announced, we'll be showcasing our purpose-built Robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August.
     Yes.

18. [Sentence #25, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
     We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

19. [Sentence #716, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
     On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
     It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
>>> Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
     Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.

     The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Alex.
     Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
     Alex Potter

Perfect.
     Thanks.
     I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing.
     You mentioned that in passing previously, was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work.
>>> I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD.
     I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack.
     So I, correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement.
     Is that the right way to think about that?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     The OEMs not real fast.
     There's not really a sensor suite, it's just cameras.
     But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360 degree view.

     Then as probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet.
     So, kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guestroom, add it to the Airbnb or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory.
     If you're traveling for a month, you can or whatever the case maybe you can let other people use your house.
     And then you can -- so that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any kinks.
     And a lot of it -- it's not like we're not splitting atoms here.
     It's just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works, especially that people can order the car, it comes to the right spot, does exactly the right thing, all the payment systems work, the billing works.
     Yes.
>>> Pierre Ferragu -- Analyst

But then so my follow-up question would be, I have a Tesla, I have FSD, and I have to keep my eyes on the road all the time.
     It's super boring because I don't really need to intervene anymore.
     And the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails.
     And so, are you working also on introducing like a kind of like free unsupervised where I could be eyes off, and I would be able to check my email and would just need to, with a five-second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on what's happening?
     Or is that something you're working on as well because it feels so close with that I wonder if it's something we could expect for this year.
     It's a very selfish question I ask for myself, to be honest.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     We need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we are able to check their email and text messages.

     Your life might depend on it.
     And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to help you because their computers don't work because the power went out and you can't charge your phone.
     Actually, happens over time.
     You literally can't even call anyone because your phone's out.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thank you very much.
     The next question was covered in opening remarks so we will skip that.
     And the last question from say.com.
>>> What technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given that V13 already covered to control?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, we're going to have a whole let further than photons to output.
     We've been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but nets from photons to controls for a while now for just improving the neural nets.
     I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree.
     I have to say I continue to be amazed by just how effective auto-aggressive transformers are at solving a wide range of problems.
     I mean, Ashok, is there anything you'd like to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets?
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Things report on next already.
     continuing to scale the model size a lot.

23. [Sentence #1911, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro environment.
     We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
     For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who helped us achieve this.
     Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
     This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which impacted ASPs.
     While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market.
     This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
>>> On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
     Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, driven primarily by material costs.
     This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
     All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
     While we feel confident in our team's abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change, and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time.
     This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
     As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch but will be overcome as production is ramped.
     We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025.

     The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
     And that's why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people don't realize that it has so much capability.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they're not like obviously super futuristic.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
>>> What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
     So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we're progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory in Reno.
     We've released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production.
     Semi growth will largely depend on our customers' adoption of the product.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don't think we're going to be limited, honestly.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.

25. [Sentence #1970, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

We want to avoid that.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     So, it's really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
     But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car -- allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were little concerned.
     But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
     And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
>>> The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     What we're seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla full self-driving technology.
     What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
     And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer.
     That's better than us selling CAD drawings.
     And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it's not worth the complexity.
     And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.

     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     guys.
     Thank you very much.
     Our next question is when will Tesla incorporate X and Grok in all Tesla vehicles?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, these are relatively small things.
     But yes, I think we'll keep expanding what is available in the car on the screen.
     And also improving like the browser so like just generally, you can access anything you want in the car.
>>> In fact, for the Tesla, once you get to full autonomy, you actually want fully a system that is -- can do anything.
     Like if you want to browse the Internet, if you want to ask AI questions, if you want to watch a movie, if you want to play a video game, if you wanted to do some productivity thing, you can do anything you want in an autonomous vehicle because you don't need to drive.
     So, that's why Cybercab's got a nice big screen and a great sound system.
     So, you can watch it, watch you're moving with.
     It's like being in a personal movie theater.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, this is why we've been building this functionality.
     I think gaming to the car, adding and other -- all sorts of different media applications of the car because that's what you're going to -- that's, yes, the cars that will be built today.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

There's some fun games, by the way.

     George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
     George Gianarikas

Hi, everyone.
     Thank you for taking my questions.
     Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second.
     And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal less, wheel less vehicle.
     And according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment.
     And from what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.
>>> Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can't make it work, not because the regulators, they're blaming regulators.
     That's misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.
     So it's just that their technology is not far.
     George Gianarikas

Right.
     And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price.
     Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly?
-----
28. [Sentence #2320, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PILOT]
     So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, I'm not sure I understand the question.
     We have a lot of cars.
     I mean, you've got millions of cars out there.
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
     Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
>>> More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
     And now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.
     That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
     But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we're talking that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call was we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another.
     That's the constraint on our output.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     All right.
-----
29. [Sentence #656, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs.
     So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market.
     And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla.
     We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term.
     And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats.
>>> Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues.
     Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business.
     And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
     We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events.
     But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year.
     The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy.
     In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
     So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them.
