--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #25]  Regarding **FSD** Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.
2. [Sentence #28]  So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with **FSD** V12.
3. [Sentence #211]  The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing **FSD** in the future?
4. [Sentence #365]  And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product **milestones** in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?
5. [Sentence #573]  Elon Musk

Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive **FSD** 12.3.
