[TSLA_Q3_2023] From 2023 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #2]  Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with **FSD** beta, **full** self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly.
2. [Sentence #4]  We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with **full** self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
3. [Sentence #159]  Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for **FSD**?
4. [Sentence #243]  But I guess, like the ultimate values of **FSD**, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around.
5. [Sentence #246]  So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of **FSD** available and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever.
