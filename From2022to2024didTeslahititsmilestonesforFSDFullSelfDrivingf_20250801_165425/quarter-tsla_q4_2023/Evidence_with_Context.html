    I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.

    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full

    Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
    Out of necessity, we&#x27;ve actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> at
this point is several years old.
    So I think we&#x27;re quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is
going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.

    I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
    And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So a much easier situation.
    And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly 
improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
    And that&#x27;s the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the 
manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.

Thank you.
    The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another 
company?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.</span>
    And we&#x27;ve had some tentative conversations, but I think they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real quite yet.
    I think that will become obvious probably this year.
    And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking
to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
    It&#x27;s definitely the smart move.

Thank you.
    The next question from Siddharth.
    What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting 
there?
