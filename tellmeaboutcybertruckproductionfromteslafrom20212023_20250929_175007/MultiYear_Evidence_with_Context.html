Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.

Great.

    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?</span>
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5657</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000">SCALE ACHIEVED</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
    Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.</span>
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.

    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, to date, over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.</span>
    We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
    But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same 
because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
    So, if we&#x27;d actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on
that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
    And the same is true of this year.
    So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
    It would not make any sense because we&#x27;ll still be part constrained.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.</span>
    That is most likely.
    But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
    So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we&#x27;re doing this year 
is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
    This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
    If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
    Capital equipment is distilled labor.
    So, what happens if you don&#x27;t actually have a labor shortage?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
    Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.</span>
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.

the revenue model?

    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> year in

    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cars to Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>?

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will so far exceed the average --

    This quarter we convert to building a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> of the Texas <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.

    The next question from institutional investors.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">18</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2480</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800080">UNCERTAIN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.
    Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
    And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">products.</span>
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.

    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
    First, I&#x27;m wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen 
platform.
    You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and 
powertrain.
    Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
    And do you believe -- we know that there&#x27;s a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> 
volts architecture, really employing your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> batteries.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don&#x27;t think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
    We&#x27;re obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
    When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
    You don&#x27;t just throw it on the line and just build it.
    So we&#x27;re going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
    Sure, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it&#x27;s something we hope the industry adopts 
as well.
    We&#x27;re also open to partnering.

    And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how do you balance the need for </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.

    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply 
chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
    So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
    I’ll be there in person.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.</span>

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>-mile range.
    Just to be clear, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> miles with the cargo.

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
    Pierre Ferragu

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>

Martin Viecha

All right.
    Let’s go to the next one.
    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; First is regarding the Cybertruck.</span>
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
    Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">27</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
    Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.</span>
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">28</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
    It&#x27;s simpler.
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> program as we steadily </span>

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">a </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">50</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
