2. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow], on the Roadster and other products.
3. [Sentence #93]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] over the course of the quarter.
4. [Sentence #225]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) And the next retail question is, Master of Coin, can you tell us anything about Tesla’s future plans in digital currency space?
5. [Sentence #355]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.

8. [Sentence #1138]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
9. [Sentence #1160]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And then we will add [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
10. [Sentence #1281]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
11. [Sentence #1282]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Will you show off the new and improved [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow]?
12. [Sentence #1285]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) We get a lot of questions on [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow].
13. [Sentence #1286]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) We've been busy detailing the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
14. [Sentence #1549]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And the second question is related to [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow].
15. [Sentence #1551]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow]?
16. [Sentence #1613]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
17. [Sentence #1658]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow], Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] hopefully next year.
18. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] volume [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] besides battery shortage?
19. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow].
20. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] that will take some time to work through.
21. [Sentence #1866]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] and to what degree is that affordable?
22. [Sentence #1869]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I worry more about like how do we the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] affordable despite having awesome technology.
23. [Sentence #1871]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
24. [Sentence #2034]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And I think you made reference to [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
25. [Sentence #2035]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
