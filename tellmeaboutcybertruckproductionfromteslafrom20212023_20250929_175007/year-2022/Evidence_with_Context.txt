[Year 2022] tell me about cybertruck production from tesla from 2021-2023

1. [Sentence #1773, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
     This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
     As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
     In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
     Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
>>> This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
-----
2. [Sentence #1291, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
     Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
     When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.
-----
3. [Sentence #1914, TSLA_Q4_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive.
     But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
     So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
     It's extremely expensive.
     And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
     So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?
     Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
     But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
     It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
     So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production.
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
-----
4. [Sentence #65, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.
     And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
     So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
>>> And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
-----
5. [Sentence #610, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
     If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.
     And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
     This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
     And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
     In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
     Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
>>> We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
     And we are very, very excited about that product.
     I think it might actually be our best product ever.
     Let’s see.
     And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
     And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts of the world.
     We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
     I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
-----
6. [Sentence #609, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
     If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.

     We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
-----
7. [Sentence #1865, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
>>> And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year.
     So it's an incredible product.
     I can't wait to drive it personally.
     It will be the car that I drive every day.
     I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
     And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.
     So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed.
     Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human.
-----
8. [Sentence #849, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
     So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in Q3 will be as big as Q2.
     But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
     And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some contracts in place.
     But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
     So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our financials.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?
     Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
     Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
-----
9. [Sentence #1635, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Before incentive.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
     We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?
-----
10. [Sentence #1308, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
>>> And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.
-----
11. [Sentence #407, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in use, get the economic model for that dialed in, and then evaluate the size of cash flows at that point and make decisions then as to what’s next.
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
     Pierre Ferragu

[Technical Difficulty]

Martin Viecha

All right.
     Let’s go to the next one.
     The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Two questions I have.
>>> First is regarding the Cybertruck.
     And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts?
     The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
     Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
-----
12. [Sentence #1258, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
-----
13. [Sentence #601, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
     As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
     We reduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
     So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
     And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
     So, it’s good on every level.
     But this journey is not over.
>>> We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
     Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision, which has never been done before.
     So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension the seatbelt.
     If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actually happens.
     And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
     This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
     And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least AP3 hardware.
     In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
-----
14. [Sentence #886, TSLA_Q2_2022] [PLAN]
     Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
     It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
     Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
>>> The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.
     And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supply chain.
     The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount battery output per year?
     This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
     So yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
     I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
     And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible?
-----
15. [Sentence #1857, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
     Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
     It was no small feat.
     Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
     As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
>>> Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
-----
16. [Sentence #1306, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
     That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
>>> So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
     And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
-----
17. [Sentence #794, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
     But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
     So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done in the past where you’ve got 120 different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
     So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact that there’s a casting.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right?
     Like we are not just evaluating the pack and insulation either, it’s the pack plus the body, the integration, do we have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount.
     And I think we’ve gone through one iteration.
>>> We’re going to do another one with Cybertruck.
     I mean, we’re taking the learnings and doing – the next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture.
     That’s certainly a target.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going?
     And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving have any significant impact on timelines or potential progress?
     Elon Musk

Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt.
     It’s irony.
-----
18. [Sentence #1789, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
-----
19. [Sentence #63, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.

Yes.
     I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
     We still have cells in [Technical Difficulty]

Elon Musk

Mention count.
     Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
     Elon Musk

I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.
     Lars Moravy

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it takes all the long-term impact.

     The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Two questions I have.
     First is regarding the Cybertruck.
     And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts?
     The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
>>> Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
     We still have cells in [Technical Difficulty]

Elon Musk

Mention count.
     Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
>>> When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.
     Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
     That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.

23. [Sentence #1778, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
     This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
>>> The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
     I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
-----
24. [Sentence #408, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
     Pierre Ferragu

[Technical Difficulty]

Martin Viecha

All right.
     Let’s go to the next one.
     The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Two questions I have.
     First is regarding the Cybertruck.
>>> And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts?
     The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
     Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
-----
25. [Sentence #1195, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     In fact, I think it will be very difficult.
     It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.
     But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco.
     And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.
     I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.
     So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
     I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, some of which you haven’t.
>>> We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.
     We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.
     And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we’re moving at top speed to do that.
     So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
     None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
     So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team.
     You guys rock.
     You’re the ones making it happen.
-----
26. [Sentence #261, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So there’s actually 10% and 15% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly [Technical Difficulty].
     So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re going to be waiting forever.
     If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
     When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
     Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
     Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
>>> So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are aiming for volume production in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of 4680 cell production at Fremont and at Giga Texas?
     What do you expect run rates of 4680 to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
     Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the 2170 nonstructural pack.
     So, they’re not constrained by 4680.
     They will transition to 4680 hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
     We also have, just as a risk mitigation, 2170 nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.
-----
27. [Sentence #1344, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
     And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
     Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
     Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
-----
28. [Sentence #64, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.
     And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
>>> So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
     And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
-----
29. [Sentence #51, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
     Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%.
     This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
     So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
     They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
     And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
>>> So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus ‘21.
     I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
     So, let’s see.
     Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
     So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
     Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
-----
30. [Sentence #1036, TSLA_Q2_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     I have two as well.
     In response to the question around demand, I think Zach, you said maybe a little, and Elon, you said maybe some indication that you might see some pressure on demand.
     And I am wondering if that is really just speculation or whether there is any empirical data that you saw in the last month, whether it would be cancellations or order lead times that led you to make that comment.
     I think anecdotally, if you squint, the lead times have gotten a little lower over the last four months in both China and the U.S. That’s really the only visibility investors have.
     So, I am wondering if you could maybe elaborate on whether that’s really just you are sort of anticipating there could be some impact because of high prices or whether they are something anecdotally or quantitatively that you could point to, please?
     Elon Musk

No.
     I mean I think we have said this now for many years, I know has proven true.
>>> Tesla does not have a demand problem, we have a production problem.
     And we have almost always had it’s a very rare exception it’s always been a production problem.
     I think that will remain the case.
     Toni Sacconaghi

So, there is a denominator and a numerator and like, you increase production?
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     As we increase production, more demand is needed obviously.
     Andrew Baglino

No, it’s more just like you can’t look at the backlog and state much about demand because we are doing a lot on the other side to change the production.
     Elon Musk

We are trying to make the backlog lower, not longer.
