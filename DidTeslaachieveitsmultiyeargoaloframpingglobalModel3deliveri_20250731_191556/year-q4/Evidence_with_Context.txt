[Year Q4] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #169, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
     Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model 3 there.
     We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the states.
     Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we're not shipping cars from California over to China.
     And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
     And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
     And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
     And so and I've said this on previous earnings calls, I think it's fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
     It kind of makes sense it's -- but what we're doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
     And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
>>> So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in China, a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
     Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
     Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And also on working capital.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     Martin Viecha

According you see OpEx here to, but it's not 2010.
     Okay.
     The next question from institutional investors is given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production i.e.
     fill te Gigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service.
     Elon Musk

Well, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly.
     So if there's any sensible way to spend money, we're spending it.
     There is no artificial hold back on expenditures anything that I see that is what looks like a -- it's got good value for money.
     The answer is yes immediately.
     So -- but we're spending money I think efficiently and we're not artificially limiting our progress.

     Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective?

     During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator Instructions] But before we jump in the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
     Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter.
     It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend.
     I think that's like where we do say that from time-time and I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of advertising.
     At our Fremont factory we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006 and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
     This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there's lot of potential to go beyond that number.
>>> For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.
     I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
     I think it's going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
     Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
     And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
     Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got EPA rating of 315 miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
     This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
     And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
     For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such product should look.
     So it really just from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks the ass of any pickup truck, basically that's the goal.
     And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand has been incredible.
     I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we've never seen anything like it basically.
     I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
     So -- as many -- we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts.
-----
4. [Sentence #76, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
     This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
     In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.
     This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
     We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.
     We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending.
     On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and international footprint.
     However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
     Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
     For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
     Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
     We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the Coronavirus.
>>> At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown.
     This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.
     We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
     So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
     However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.
     Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY [ph] Technologies.
     So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
     What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
     So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in North America on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
     So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation.
     But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form or another.
-----
5. [Sentence #164, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, they would -- you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions.
     The number one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity.
     Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective?
     And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
     Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.

6. [Sentence #68, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
     Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.
     And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
     We've also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
     Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
     This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.
     As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
     Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.

7. [Sentence #461, TSLA_Q4_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So, just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels.
     Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5 million cars.
     I'd just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
     We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
     So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020.
     So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
     So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.
     We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
     Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
     We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
>>> We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
     We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
     We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
     This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
     We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
     We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
     And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
     And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
     Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X are in production now and will be delivered in February.
     So we've been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
     And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
     The Model S Plaid, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month.
     So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior.
     There are actually a lot of great things about this.
-----
8. [Sentence #65, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
     With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
     As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
     This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
     Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.

9. [Sentence #353, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     Yes.
     Coming out later this year end of the year, probably, that's our goal, get Powertrain up end of the year and then it's going to be like -- this is like alien technology, it's insane.
     I think, I think we could do, yes, I mean I think there was no way, this could get engineering team, Tesla to a little about hardcore engineering.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening, everybody.
     So in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in 2020.
     Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve, obviously you have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price.
     So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like steadily in 2020?
     Elon Musk

Making the price better and better, so is the value.
     I know we're wondering we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand looks like, I mean like right now it's pretty good, maybe they will change who knows, yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

But I think the way you described, it is fair.
>>> So I mean, relative to the current Model 3, China Model 2 pricing is slightly lower.
     And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
     So you can see that it's clearly slightly higher than what Model 3 is out of Fremont.
     How the mix of those three products and that's out over the course of the year, we'll see.
     I think it's probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP, when you average them together.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I mean the affordability of our car and trying to improve radically because for a very -- to tariffs mostly going to weigh, purchase tax exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the ocean.
     So the affordability is nine day for our car intent.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
     Thank you for taking the question.
     Just want to follow-up on the question on capital raise.
-----
10. [Sentence #303, TSLA_Q4_2019] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?
     Elon Musk

You know, we're not quite sure what's going to happen with, but it is true that Model X, the introduction of Model X actually increased Model S sales because you would come in, look at the Model X and they like said okay, I'd prefer the Sedan and we're worried that X sales would of course S sales drop there -- actually could increase.
     So from us -- we're not too worried about demand, we are worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y.
     And it's hard for -- it's always to hard predict what -- the exponential part of the S curve of production.
     Production pretty much always follows those S-curve or it's kind of like a herky-jerky S-curve.
     And you can use to predict what it's going to be like in the beginning because it's flow and it is pretty question like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S curve is very difficult to predict.
     So that's and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
     So, I think we're just going to have go as best we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product.
     I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- does on our October analyst call.
     And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of the things they see.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next 18 to 24 months.
     But what we're working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally produced in all location.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Also the rule of thumb of 10%, I think you need to see it when you see the car, you realize that it's not just a 10% different car.
     It's not just that -- there is more change happening like to the customers' perspective as well.
     Unidentified Analyst

All right, thank guys.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much guys.
     Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reduction, as well as the mission to increase EV adoption.
     Is there a target for gross profit or operating profit on a per-vehicle basis that we should be thinking about or how should we really frame that for ourselves?
     Elon Musk

Yes, I mean we're trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable -- while still being at least a little bit profitable and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash flow and accumulating our cash balance.
     Zach, anything you want to add?
-----
11. [Sentence #270, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10-K, but back to the growth rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support that growth.
     So that helps.
     And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to continue to fund additional factory.
     So I wouldn't necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our [indiscernible] a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of 50%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question.
     Operator

Our next question comes from [indiscernible].
     Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
     First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
     Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don't comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, three or four years, something like that.
     So the thing we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one product to another and you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles.
>>> So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model 3 or Model Y cars.
     So we've got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt of the batteries.
     This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
     So that we said we're going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans are.
     I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
     So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
     Unidentified Analyst

Great.
     I'll look forward to that Battery Day.
     Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not announced for Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that project?
     Elon Musk

Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery capacity otherwise we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
     So what we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet.
     And it's just generally true when I see some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, whether pointing out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the average number of occupants in a car, I think is like 1.2 and maybe with autonomy maybe it will go to 1.4 maybe, but I'm not sure if that -- it even goes there.
     So, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or something like probably, but like I said we're going to solve those battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even balance today, that's the real problem.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

12. [Sentence #87, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
     We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the Coronavirus.
     At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown.
     This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.
     We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
     So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
     However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.
     Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY [ph] Technologies.
     So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
     What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
>>> So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in North America on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
     So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation.
     But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form or another.
     It's really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
     And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it's the future we want.
     So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
     And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla [indiscernible] network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
     If so when will this happen?
     Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.
     Elon Musk

Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?
     Martin Viecha

Yes, it's a bit of a bundle, yes.
     Elon Musk

Well, I think it's – it probably will make sense to have like to enable car sharing in advance of the kind of sort of drive robo-taxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before full self-driving is approved by regulators.
-----
13. [Sentence #163, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Well, I guess, we don't have to -- I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and to me better insight than many of the analysts.
     It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, they would -- you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions.
     The number one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity.
     Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective?
     And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
     Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model 3 there.
     We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the states.
     Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we're not shipping cars from California over to China.
     And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
>>> And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
     And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
     And so and I've said this on previous earnings calls, I think it's fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars 3 and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
     It kind of makes sense it's -- but what we're doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
     And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
     So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in China, a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
     Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
     Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And also on working capital.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     Martin Viecha

According you see OpEx here to, but it's not 2010.
     Okay.
     The next question from institutional investors is given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production i.e.
-----
14. [Sentence #654, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And one more question is from retail investors.
     What is Tesla doing to improve service experience?
     Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service.
     Now it's impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.
     Jerome?
     Jerome Guillen

Yes.
     Well, as far as best service, no service.
     So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
     In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
>>> One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
     We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
     In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
     So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
     And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
     We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
     For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
     We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
     In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
     So that's what we're doing to improve service.
     In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
     Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
     And we are trying to move away from the phone.
-----
15. [Sentence #783, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zach, do you want to – I don’t know, Zach and Jerome?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

The – what we're seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is pretty dynamic space, but it's overall not particularly limiting on a rule basis, but what we're going to expect is to have to work with regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before.
     The rest of the world is fairly dynamic.
     In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally not reaching past Level 3 right now with some impetus to start working on new working groups to reach past that.
     And China showed an interest in working on Level 4 or even Level 5 later this year.
     So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space.
     We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
     And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
     Obviously, there's a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
     Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you're migrating some of your exposure around some of your raw material costs?
     Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
>>> Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and North America.
     But we're also looking forward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components.
     We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you're going to have enough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate sharing of the risk.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
     Thank you.
     Two questions, one on 2021 and just one on capital.
     First, on 2021.
     Any expectations for what we should see on regulatory credit sales?
     And then the second question is on capital.
     Obviously, you raised a lot of capital in 2020.
     What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering some of the maturities?
-----
16. [Sentence #74, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
     Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
     This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
     In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.
     This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
     We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.
     We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending.
     On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and international footprint.
     However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
     Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
     For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
>>> Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
     We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the Coronavirus.
     At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown.
     This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.
     We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
     So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
     However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.

17. [Sentence #55, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
     So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
     If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
     So where we will be in 10 years, very excited to consider the prospect.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this happen.
     On 2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight.
     On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
     We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
     With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
     As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
>>> This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
     Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.
     And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
     We've also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
     Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
     This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.
     As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
     Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
     This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
     In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.
     This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
     We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall.
     Since most retail investors seem to understand Tesla better than analysts and we think a larger part of their own personal wealth on Tesla doesn't make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us vis SAY.
     Do you even have to take questions -- answer questions from analysts?
     Elon Musk

Well, I guess, we don't have to -- I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and to me better insight than many of the analysts.
     It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, they would -- you would probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.

     I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
     And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.

     On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
     We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
>>> With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
     As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
     This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
     Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.
     And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
     We've also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
     Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
     This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.
     As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
     Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
     This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
     In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.

     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
     This year for the Shanghai built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
     In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the region.
     This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
     We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.
     We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending.
     On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and international footprint.
     However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
     Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
     For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
     Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
     We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the Coronavirus.
     At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown.
>>> This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.
     We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
     So far we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
     However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance sheet.
     Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you.
     We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY [ph] Technologies.
     So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
     What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, [indiscernible] from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass Roof.
     So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in North America on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
     So, we see a lot of interest and so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation.
     But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form or another.
     It's really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.

     As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
     Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
     Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
     We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
     Global demand continues to outpace production, and we're moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
     I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can jump straight into questions from [Safe] [ph] Technologies.
     The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
     And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
     So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
>>> It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
     But now we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
     So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing.
     And so that's something that we've accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become the leader in the space.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar and Tesla Roof.
     And we're confident we'll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or but [indiscernible] roof before the end of the year.
     So it's really – I think we've got a good strategy.
     As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.
     And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?

     I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
     So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
     Unidentified Analyst

Great.
     I'll look forward to that Battery Day.
     Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not announced for Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that project?
     Elon Musk

Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery capacity otherwise we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
     So what we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet.
     And it's just generally true when I see some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, whether pointing out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the average number of occupants in a car, I think is like 1.2 and maybe with autonomy maybe it will go to 1.4 maybe, but I'm not sure if that -- it even goes there.
     So, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or something like probably, but like I said we're going to solve those battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even balance today, that's the real problem.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Our next question comes from John Sagar [ph] with Evercore ISI.
     Unidentified Analyst

Thanks for taking my call.
>>> I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb, just around cargo and size.
     Are there other features that are going to differentiate the two models.
     And then as a follow on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grew with the introduction of Model X.
     So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?
     Elon Musk

You know, we're not quite sure what's going to happen with, but it is true that Model X, the introduction of Model X actually increased Model S sales because you would come in, look at the Model X and they like said okay, I'd prefer the Sedan and we're worried that X sales would of course S sales drop there -- actually could increase.
     So from us -- we're not too worried about demand, we are worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y.
     And it's hard for -- it's always to hard predict what -- the exponential part of the S curve of production.
     Production pretty much always follows those S-curve or it's kind of like a herky-jerky S-curve.
     And you can use to predict what it's going to be like in the beginning because it's flow and it is pretty question like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S curve is very difficult to predict.
     So that's and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
     So, I think we're just going to have go as best we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product.
     I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- does on our October analyst call.
     And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of the things they see.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next 18 to 24 months.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next 18 to 24 months.
     But what we're working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally produced in all location.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.

25. [Sentence #186, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PILOT]
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     Martin Viecha

According you see OpEx here to, but it's not 2010.
     Okay.
     The next question from institutional investors is given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production i.e.
     fill te Gigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service.
     Elon Musk

Well, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly.
     So if there's any sensible way to spend money, we're spending it.
     There is no artificial hold back on expenditures anything that I see that is what looks like a -- it's got good value for money.
     The answer is yes immediately.
     So -- but we're spending money I think efficiently and we're not artificially limiting our progress.
     And then despite all that we are still generating positive cash.
     So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.
     Zach, you can…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I completely agree with that.
>>> I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period where we grew too quickly and with too much complexity.
     And it held back our ability to continue to scale and part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to underline a series of unintentional that process is that kind of accumulated in the company over time.
     And so that's kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that.
     And now we've laid a good foundation and I think and I agree with you on that we're not holding back on the growth.
     I mean we have two products, two vehicle products launching right now and that will consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year.
     And then looking into next year, we have even more products launching, more factors.
     So we want to be smart about how we spend money and grow in a way that's sustainable.
     So we don't positive term to the mistakes I think we made a year and a half or so.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question we've already answered regarding Autopilot timelines.
     So, the following question would be, can we please talk about cost control and OpEx sustainability in terms of growth versus gross profit growth.
     How did we achieve the recent OpEx trends and how should we think about OpEx needs as we grow both vehicles and geographic workloads?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I commented briefly on this in my opening remarks.

     I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
     Their attention to detail is incredible.
     So they -- I'm confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
     And we hopefully that is later this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
     Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
     What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
>>> It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
     So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.

     Now it's impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.
     Jerome?
     Jerome Guillen

Yes.
     Well, as far as best service, no service.
     So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
     In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
     One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
     We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
     In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
     So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
     And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
>>> We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
     For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
     We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
     In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
     So that's what we're doing to improve service.
     In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
     Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
     And we are trying to move away from the phone.
     As the app is much better than the phone.
     It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.
     And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.
     You can have pictures in there.
     You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff.

     Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies.
     Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin.
     Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, including onboarding costs associated with new service capacity.
     However, what's most important here is that we've accelerated the growth in service capacity and we’ll continue to drive capacity expansion as fast as possible.
     On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof related ramp costs and typical seasonality in the lease PPA business.
     OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despite impacts from items mentioned, as well as increased investment in development of future products.
     Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million of interest expense for the quarter.
     All that being said, nothing has changed about our view that operating margin will continue to grow and remain industry leading.
     As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet, as we see the benefits of long-standing investments in capacity and technology.
     The range of possible outcomes this year is wide, given the magnitude of launches.
     That's a few things we should keep in mind.
     We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of 50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021.
     As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year's story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
>>> Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
     Additionally, we're working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port capacity, which may have a temporary impact.

Thank you very much.
     And now we can jump straight into questions from [Safe] [ph] Technologies.
     The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share leader in solar?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
     And we had our best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4.
     So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
     It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model 3 production and building.
     We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.

     So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
     In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
     So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
     And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
     One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in North America.
     We're trying to push that to 50% this year.
     In 50% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
     So we're trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
     And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
     We have about -- we have actually 140 service centers right now in North America.
     For 100 out of those 140, you can get appointments in less than 10 days.
     And we're going to make sure it's all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
     We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
>>> In North America, we opened 11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.
     So that's what we're doing to improve service.
     In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
     Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
     And we are trying to move away from the phone.
     As the app is much better than the phone.
     It can spot directly alerts, directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.
     And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.
     You can have pictures in there.
     You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card and doing all that stuff.
     You get updates on the service.
     And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app.
     And I think everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is and how far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there.
     So we are investing everything on the app.

     So and then stepping back in 2018 from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than $1 billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production.
     So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of the Tesla team and I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.
     I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
     And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
     So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
     If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
     So where we will be in 10 years, very excited to consider the prospect.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this happen.
     On 2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight.
>>> On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
     We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
     With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
     As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
     This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
     Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.
     And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation.
     We've also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
     Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
     This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.
     As we look ahead to 2020, this again will be an important year for the company.
     Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
     On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters.
     As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.
