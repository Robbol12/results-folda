America, Europe, and China?

    And so, I think there’s merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add to that, the journey we’ve been on for the last <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months on being more efficient and how we spend 
money has really changed the full trends of the company.
    It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well.
    And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
    So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
    Elon Musk

And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $<span class="r2">500</span> million.
    So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...</span>

<span class="r4">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.</span>
    It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated 
to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for 
customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
    So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    That makes sense.
    Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was 
focused on closing storefronts.
    A fair amount of noise made around that.
    And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">546</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in</span>
<span class="r4">North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4"> million units a year.</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.

    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those

    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r7">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r7">]</span> But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America </span>
<span class="r4">experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.</span>
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
    This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global 
deliveries occurring in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.

    Elon Musk

In Q2, we don’t we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the significant ones that we’re aware of.
    Maynard Um

Okay.
    And I guess there was some concern out there that Model <span class="r2">3</span> was cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different
vehicle classes, and it doesn’t sound like you’re saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence 
that proves, disproves this?
    Any thoughts there would be helpful.
    Elon Musk

No, they’re reducing through different market segments.
    Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And also, not only <span class="r2">3.5</span>% of our trade-ins for Model <span class="r2">3</span> are coming from Model S. So, it’s from all the Model <span class="r2">3</span> trade-ins, 
Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
    Elon Musk

Yes, for sure.
    People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.

Martin Viecha

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
    Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
    A couple of questions.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; One, you mentioned a $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is </span>
<span class="r4">that a number like since the February </span><span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4"> price adjustments?</span>
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
    And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over <span class="r2">50</span>% 
of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .
    Dan Galves

That’s really helpful.
    And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
    So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
    But on Model <span class="r2">3</span>, whatever your assumption is within the <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is 
for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, does your current order flow support that?
    Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
    Elon Musk

I think we’ll I think we’ll be fine.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">40</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made

    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
    They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model <span class="r2">3</span> more than they ever wanted a 
vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally </span>
<span class="r4">than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the </span>
<span class="r4">Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.</span>
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.
    So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">75</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This led to a binary inflow of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.</span>
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
    We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee 
of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes.
    There is an additional $<span class="r2">67</span> million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
    One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February <span class="r2">28</span> as well as the makeshift towards the standard range 
lineup which we launched.
    We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and
scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4">, </span>
<span class="r4">with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, 
the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
    As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
    From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
    So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
    As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity <span class="r2">50</span>% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. and 
then <span class="r2">50</span>% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
    And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model <span class="r2">3</span> platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for 
capital efficient expansion.
    In energy as well, as we have noted previously, <span class="r2">2019</span> is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements 
coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned 
investments in that.
    So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company 
and I am looking forward to the discussion.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zachary.
    Let’s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
    So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">615</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r4">3</span>
<span class="r4">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">556</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is our second large-scale product launch since Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in </span><span class="r4">2017</span><span class="r4"> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on </span>
<span class="r4">cost control and ramp efficiency.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.

    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.

    Our Q1 results were announced at about <span class="r9">1:00</span> p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as 
this webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today&#x27;s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r7">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r7">]</span> Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; After the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.</span>
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">62</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
    And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will 
fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The global expansion of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> was a huge theme within the quarter.</span>
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">13</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">346</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add to that, the journey we’ve been on for the last <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months on being more efficient and how we spend 
money has really changed the full trends of the company.
    It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well.
    And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
    So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
    Elon Musk

And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $<span class="r2">500</span> million.
    So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
    Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their 
deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to<span class="r10">...</span>

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated </span>
<span class="r4">to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for </span>
<span class="r4">customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.</span>
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
    So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    That makes sense.
    Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was 
focused on closing storefronts.
    A fair amount of noise made around that.
    And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy.
    I was just wondering if there’s any update there.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">225</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

I think we expect demand to – we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2.
    And it might be a little better than normal.
    I don’t have a crystal ball, it’s hard for me to say, but my impression right now is that demand is quite solid, 
quite strong, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

And then my second question was briefly on<span class="r10">...</span>

Elon Musk

Sorry, Zach would like to<span class="r10">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X.
    We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted.
    That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension
and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
    So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and
then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
    It’s already increasing.
    Pierre Ferragu

And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am
surprised you don’t – you just still expect a loss.
    So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a 
profit for similar volumes?
    How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much 
is related to pricing and other things?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of </span>
<span class="r4">the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.</span>
    And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it’s West Coast or East Coast, then we could 
deliver more cars.
    But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but 
really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just – not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive 
efforts from Tesla team.
    So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind
this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
    And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
    Two other things that I would add.
    One is we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margin.
    And so that’s part of what we will see in Q2.
    The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost efficiency of the business 
without sacrificing growth and that in combination with the efficiencies from unwinding the wave, is where we feel we 
will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of those pieces are in place.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

    Let’s go to the next question.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">15</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r7">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r7">]</span> But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
    Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America 
experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries occurring in the final </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> days of Q1.</span>
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
    Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
    A couple of questions.
    One, you mentioned a $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is 
that a number like since the February <span class="r2">28</span> price adjustments?
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% </span>
<span class="r4">of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .</span>
    Dan Galves

That’s really helpful.
    And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
    So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
    But on Model <span class="r2">3</span>, whatever your assumption is within the <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is 
for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, does your current order flow support that?
    Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
    Elon Musk

I think we’ll I think we’ll be fine.
    Yes, I don’t think there any major thing required.

    Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort
of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and 
its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base.

    Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort
of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and 
its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base.
    And given that you used up about $<span class="r2">2</span> billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren’t you potentially trying to go 
through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic.
    So why not raise capital?
    And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn’t do?
    Or wouldn’t do?

    One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
    For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California
or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
    But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
    So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada 
and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will 
hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you.
    Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
    Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
    Your guidance for <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere 
between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
    Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or
reservation list maybe telling you?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The standard range plus Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> with autopilot included at $</span><span class="r4">39</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">500</span><span class="r4"> is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and </span>
<span class="r4">affordable to probably something on the order like the top </span><span class="r4">40</span><span class="r4">% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.</span>
    So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that.
    We are.
    And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X 
upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade.
    So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant.
    And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we 
are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December <span class="r2">31</span>.
    So, these were all very positive factors.
    We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model <span class="r2">3</span> and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive 
countries.
    Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.
    Ryan Brinkman

Okay, thanks.
    And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, 
because it was I think you said packed to the gills.
    I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada.
    Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find 
more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">19</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">575</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>
<span class="r4">in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai.</span>
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.

    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r2">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> as well, and so we have experience with</span>
<span class="r4">that both with Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.</span>
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
    But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> once we have 
reached say, <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> or <span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units or something like that and…<span class="r7">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r7">]</span>.

    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r2">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already </span>
<span class="r4">lower than the cost to produce the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.</span>
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
    But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">22</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">53</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally 
than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the 
Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.
    So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production</span>
<span class="r4">levels.</span>
    And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will 
fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.

    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
    Joseph Spak

First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of <span class="r2">25</span>% non-GAAP gross margin that you’re targeting.
    Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year?
    And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach here, that’s  so we’re targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working towards 
S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner.
    The biggest lever there is actually two components.
    One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there’s just a natural benefit there from the 
fixed cost absorption which will help us.
    But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we’re executing on over the course of the year.
    And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we’re seeing an increased take rate on our full
Self-Driving offering.
    And there are, revenue associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there.
    And as that option becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more revenue on that.
    So all of these things together within our internal gives us .
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because </span>
<span class="r4">we essentially took the high volume, we’re driving units of the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> which is extremely efficient magnet motor and </span>
<span class="r4">product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X.</span>
    And so, we’re actually able to get cost reduction while improving range and  of the car.
    That’s just <span class="r2">1</span> example.
    Joseph Spak

Okay.
    The second question is just looking at the <span class="r2">10</span>-K, you’ve notice $<span class="r2">4.9</span> billion purchase obligation, which I think is 
primarily related to Panasonic Giga <span class="r2">1</span>.
    And then Elon, in some of your communication, you’ve indicated production constraints.
    I guess the question is, does that $<span class="r2">4.9</span> billion correlate to reaching that <span class="r2">35</span> gigawatt hour rate?
    And if you can’t hit that because of production constraints, does that adjust?
    Unidentified Company Speaker

This is .
    So, the purchase obligation in the <span class="r2">10</span>-K is basically for the entire contract which we have for Panasonic.
    It’s not something that we need to hit.
    I mean, make the purchases tomorrow.
    So this is going to take a couple of years.
    Joseph Spak

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.
    Colin Langan

Great thanks for taking my question I mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don’t see that there’s a 
demand issue for some of the product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when 
there is a demand issue.
    So, what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?
    Elon Musk

I mean, our goal, as we’ve been very clear about from the beginning of the company, is to make our cars as affordable as
possible.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we thought it was important to offer the $</span><span class="r4">35</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and then to create a sort of bundled package for the </span>
<span class="r4">Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> with the increased range because we think actually that difference between </span><span class="r4">220</span><span class="r4"> and </span><span class="r4">240</span><span class="r4"> is quite important more </span>
<span class="r4">people realizing in range and posher interior and Autopilot.</span>
    So, we thought a product that’s really just knows the sweet spot, which I think the $<span class="r2">39</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> Model <span class="r2">3</span> is just really 
nail the sweet spot and raising consumer response accordingly.
    You can tell by the $<span class="r2">35</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> version of the Model <span class="r2">3</span> that, of course, didn’t have Autopilot and has a software 
introspection, that kind of thing.
    It’s like slightly more inconvenience to buy just have to make a phone call or visit a store.
    So, it’s just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something.
    But we see very few people actually take us up on that $<span class="r2">35</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> offer, but it’s there and will remain there.
    Colin Langan

As a follow up, you’re still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year.
    Are you still confident in the <span class="r2">3</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> per week?
    And do you have a battery supplier yet that’s getting pretty close to the point?
    Elon Musk

Yes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well.
    Tesla the execution of our team underground there.
    I get daily e-mails with Tesla picture from one day to next from Tom who leads the Gigafactory program.
    And so, we’re obviously discussing or getting updates <span class="r2">7</span> days a week.
    So, I mean, I’m in that Gigafactory e-mail.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">26</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">580</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai is the dramatically </span>
<span class="r4">improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.

most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.

    Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
    Your guidance for <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere 
between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
    Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or
reservation list maybe telling you?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and <span class="r2">3</span>.
    The standard range plus Model <span class="r2">3</span> with autopilot included at $<span class="r2">39</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and 
affordable to probably something on the order like the top <span class="r2">40</span>% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.
    So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that.
    We are.
    And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X 
upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade.
    So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant.
    And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we 
are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December <span class="r2">31</span>.
    So, these were all very positive factors.
    We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive </span>
<span class="r4">countries.</span>
    Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.
    Ryan Brinkman

Okay, thanks.
    And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, 
because it was I think you said packed to the gills.
    I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada.
    Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find 
more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?
    Elon Musk

Well, first of all, obviously on account of tents, like I mean, we like hardcore tents, so I am not like Cub Scout 
tents, which are fine, but this is actually – credit goes to Tesla team, because they actually look at how could we do 
this in Fremont if we had to and we feel like we can actually append building space to the – to the west side of the 
building and use a lot of internal space that’s currently used for warehousing in the Fremont factory.
    And so we believe it actually can be done with minimal disruption to add Model Y to Fremont.
    Ryan Brinkman

Thank you.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hey, thanks for the call.
    My first question is really on the Model S and Model X and Elon, you said you are comfortable with the one you see –
based on what you saw in April, do you think that the <span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units per quarter is the level of demand that is where you 
see the market coming back already or are we not there yet?
    And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 probably hurt a lot of demand for S and X?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">28</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">39</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> more than they ever wanted a </span>
<span class="r4">vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally 
than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the 
Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.
    So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The balance to the $</span><span class="r4">1.5</span><span class="r4"> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">operations overseas.</span>
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
    We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">30</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">98</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
    One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February <span class="r2">28</span> as well as the makeshift towards the standard range 
lineup which we launched.
    We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and
scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
    In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, 
with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, 
the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
    As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
    From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
    So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in the U.S. and </span>
<span class="r4">then </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.</span>
    And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model <span class="r2">3</span> platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for 
capital efficient expansion.
    In energy as well, as we have noted previously, <span class="r2">2019</span> is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements 
coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned 
investments in that.
    So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company 
and I am looking forward to the discussion.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zachary.
    Let’s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
    So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies?
    What is holding that back?
    Elon Musk

Jonathan, do you want to?
    Jonathan Chang

Yes, hi, it’s Jonathan Chang as our Counsel here.
    Right now, we are just going through approvals with the SEC.
    There is not a whole lot of things holding it back.
    We are on schedule, we are on track.
    Right now, we are looking to close in mid-May.
