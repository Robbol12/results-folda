[TSLA_Q1_2019] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in **Europe**, similar to what ****North** **America**** experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to **China**.
2. [Sentence #25]  This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our ****global** **deliveries**** occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.
3. [Sentence #40]  And keep in mind, **global** expansion for the ****Model** 3** has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the **Model** S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
4. [Sentence #62]  The **global** expansion of ****Model** 3** was a huge theme within the quarter.
5. [Sentence #75]  This led to a binary inflow of ****Model** 3** cars to EMEA and **China** and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
6. [Sentence #91]  In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that **North** American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of ****Model** 3**.
7. [Sentence #225]  So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and **Europe** and in the second half almost exclusively for ****North** **America****.
8. [Sentence #290]  One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for ****North** **America**** **Model** 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments?
9. [Sentence #345]  Is that basically saying that people in **Europe** and **China** are just going to need to wait longer to take their **deliveries** and you’re going to try to emphasize more in ****North** **America**** in order to...

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
10. [Sentence #346]  It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to **China**, **Europe** cars, and the second half is dedicated to **North** American cars that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
