[TSLA_Q1_2020] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #66] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
     I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
     So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
>>> And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
     A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
     We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
     This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
     It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.

2. [Sentence #135] [PLAN]
     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
     That is our goal.
     And we think that, that's the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
     And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
     So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
     To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
>>> And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.
     And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
     In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?
     Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
     That's one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.

     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
     We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
     Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
     We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.
     As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
     This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.

     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.

5. [Sentence #22] [PILOT]
     I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
     Our Q1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
     Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
>>> After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
     In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
     Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
     We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.
     This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
     Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
     All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
     Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive and making them better and better.
     I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined.

     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.

     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
>>> Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
     Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
     While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
     More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
     Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
     The Tesla team has done a great job here.
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.
     It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.

7. [Sentence #380] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     A couple of thoughts there for Y.
     The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
     So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3.
     And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
     So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
     And so that helps create some of the margin.
     And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
     But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3 when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
     On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
     The commonality is huge.
     It's very important.
>>> And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well, and so we have experience with that both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
     And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
     So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
     There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
     And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
     Elon Musk

It's good.
     We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
     So it's tax.
     It's not make the product worse.
     It's -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how we can make it lighter and simpler.
     And so it's -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
     But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].

Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, your conference will resume momentarily.

     That's one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
     And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
     And we've talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
     So I think that there's clearly an uncertain future ahead.
     It's a bit of a bumpy road.
     But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.

Thank you very much.
     So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.

10. [Sentence #57] [PLAN]
     On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X.
     Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
     And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range.
     And as a result, it had a 391 test.
     As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.
     And of course, we're not stopping there.
     We're looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
     For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we're underway casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
     In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
     I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
>>> So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
     And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
