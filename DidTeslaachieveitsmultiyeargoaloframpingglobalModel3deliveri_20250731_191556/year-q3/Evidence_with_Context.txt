[Year Q3] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #430, TSLA_Q3_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     Let's go to the next question, please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

Hi.
     Thank you for taking my question.
     I just feel how you...

Elon Musk

Hi, Pierre.
     We cannot hear you.
     Martin Viecha

It's very quiet, so we can't hear you.
     Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me now?
     Elon Musk

It's muffled, but we'll try.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Sorry for that.
     So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.
>>> It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model 3 has indeed cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.
     So how are you thinking about these two models going forward?
     What's the strategy you have in mind?
     And I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.

Elon Musk

The Model S and X are really niche -- they're really niche products.
     I mean, they're very expensive, made in low volume.
     To be totally frank, we're continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else.
     They're really of minor importance to the future.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     That makes sense.
     And then, my question...

Elon Musk

They're great cars.
     The Model S I think if you want -- I mean, the Model S literally won Motor Trend's best car ever in history by the way.
     I think if you're out there and you're buying -- and you're going to buy a Model S, I think you just made a mistake, to be totally frank.
     It's incredible, especially the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for air purification, the raven powertrain.
     It's the fastest car in the world, and it's just so easy to drive.
-----
2. [Sentence #324, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand.
     And so, I think there is a bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.
     And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us.
     It's hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company.
     And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there.
     So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.
     Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I'll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that because we know there's been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
     And foreign exchange is just something that since we don't hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every quarter.
     So we'll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
     George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
     This is George Dailey on for Adam.
>>> So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model 3 sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it's a good question.
     At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory.
     There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down.
     And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering.
     So I think just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of the Fremont facility.
     George Dailey

Great.
     And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it's been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don't even offer one right now.
     As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?
     Elon Musk

Yeah, I think there's -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
     So it's something we're open to.
     As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
     And we're definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
-----
3. [Sentence #105, TSLA_Q3_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.
     We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.
     Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly.
     As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull in the timeline for other major projects.
     Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth and our financial health continues to strengthen.
     We remain focused on reducing cost which enables rapid investments in future programs and growth.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And I think also our Director of Energy Operations Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
     Kunal Girotra

Hi, everyone.
     My name is Kanal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying our energy products.
     I now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams.
     Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage businesses.
     As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50% over last quarter, and our energy storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.
>>> In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into three sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.
     Elon Musk

Actually, if I may interject.
     What a lot of people don't realize is, in California and in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's no money down, and you instantly save on your utility bill, and there's no long-term contract.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Right.
     Elon Musk

So, it's kind of a no-brainer.
     It's really, do you want something that prints money?
     And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or take it back.
     It's kind of a no-brainer.
     And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributor global utility...

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Elon Musk

On the energy side.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, absolutely.
     The subscription solar offering that you mentioned has launched in six states, and like you said, it's six monthly payments and no long-term contracts, and the response from customers has been pretty awesome so far.
     Elon Musk

Most people do actually buy it, as opposed to rent it, which actually is technically the better -- while you make money immediately if you rental, it's actually a better investment if you buy it, because the cost of capital of the consumer is better than our cost of capital.
     And then, there's an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other organizations that show that adding solar to your home increases the price -- increases the value of your home, and the Zillow study showed a 4% increase in the value of the home with solar.
-----
4. [Sentence #181, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Yeah, what we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production.
     We have no plans to advertise at this time.
     At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure they are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo-taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, when you look over the next three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don't understand or have missed?
     Elon Musk

I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking about.
     In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla's automotive sector or business.
     This is the most underappreciated group.
     I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.
     Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.
     And part of it is like, for about 18 months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources.
     We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production -- fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model 3.
     So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells.
>>> Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage.
     And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.
     And but we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive.
     So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.
     But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future.
     And Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
     And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products.
     And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars.
     Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars is like, don't they use dirty power from coal?
     Well, no, we're solar power.
     Obviously the solar power came from companies, not just Tesla.
     Yeah, sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that's what we're doing.
     And we'll do more of it.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.

     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Q - Martin Viecha

So, the first question from institutional investors is, what are the opportunities for Tesla to create demand?
     Is word of mouth still sufficient or should we expect to see Tesla commerce advertising in the near future.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, what we're seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production.
     We have no plans to advertise at this time.
     At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure they are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising.

6. [Sentence #257, TSLA_Q3_2019] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     DeepScale is a very tiny company.
     It's basically about 12 people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
     So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly accelerate FSD.
     That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
     Yeah.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
     So we'll jump to the third question from Craig.
     News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.
     Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga 3?
     And confirm purpose of the second building now being built.
     Is that for battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
>>> Elon Musk

Yeah, we're in trial production of Model 3, basically sending cars through the system, and we're ramping rapidly.
     We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
     The second building is indeed for battery and module production.
     And there's probably -- there's obviously a bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously we need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla car insurance?
     Is there a timeline to expand it nationally and internationally?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I can take that.
     So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California.
     I have to say that I'm quite pleased by the results so far.
     The take rates as measured by quote-to-purchase conversion are quite high by industry standards, and we expect that this will only increase as folks understand the products better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standard carriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative.
     There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly the purchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers.
     And we're also working very hard to get other states lined up in the States, and then also to launch in some countries internationally.
     So we're not able to provide specific timelines on those changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can, given how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California.

     So if you were to include that, which is obviously recognized as we release the full self-driving functionalities, the actual gross margin we're operating in on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's now go to questions from retail investors.
     The first question from Craig is, can you provide more detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its importance, and whether Tesla is still on track to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city streets by the end of 2019?
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     DeepScale is a very tiny company.
     It's basically about 12 people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
     So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly accelerate FSD.

     It makes you feel like Superman driving that car.
     It's incredibly safe.
     It's just an amazing vehicle.
     And then, Model S, I think, is like Faberge egg of cars.
     I mean, not Model X.
     Model X is like the Faberge egg of cars.
     Yeah, that's why so many artists and musicians buy the car.
     It's an art piece basically.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, just to add -- I agree.
     They're absolutely phenomenal cars.
     And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.
>>> And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that's kind of consumed a lot of the attention around the company.
     But now as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3.
     So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter.
     And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4.
     Elon Musk

I mean, Model S -- basic Model S at this point has a range of 370 miles.
     Actually, technically it's 373, but we actually certified it incorrectly as 370, but it's 373.
     And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.
     I forgot to mention, we're also expecting there's going to be an over-the-air improvement that will improve the power of the Model S, X, and 3.
     That's, by the way coming in a few weeks.
     Should be in the order of 5% power improvement due to improved firmware.
     Drew, do you want to say anything on that?
     Drew Baglino

Yeah, we just continue to learn how to optimize the motor control in our products.
     And yeah, so 5% improvement for all Model 3 customers and 3% for S and X.

Elon Musk

Yeah, and there's also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.

Very excited about that.

For Standard Range and Standard Range Plus customers, which is a big deal.

I don't think there's ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and it gets way better over time just through the software.

     So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model 3 sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it's a good question.
>>> At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory.
     There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down.
     And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering.
     So I think just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of the Fremont facility.
     George Dailey

Great.
     And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it's been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don't even offer one right now.
     As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?
     Elon Musk

Yeah, I think there's -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
     So it's something we're open to.
     As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
     And we're definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question, please.

12. [Sentence #91, TSLA_Q3_2019] [NO EVIDENCE]
     The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend.
     This has enabled year to date positive free cash flows for the company.
     Our cash balance increased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest quarter-ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.
     Specifically, on captive leases, we've received a number of questions on how these are funded.
     We use our leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash.
     What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow, and as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow.
     This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rate increased substantially by 50%.
     In addition, CapEx spend increased, driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Y spending.
     We've received a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared to prior levels, even though there are multiple new projects launching and in development.
     As we noted in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made great progress on improving our capital efficiency.
     My third and final point is around demand and growth.
     Our global order rate remains strong and continues to increase.
     Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing, and quarter to date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.
>>> In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and Model X as quickly as we can.
     The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.
     We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.
     Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly.
     As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull in the timeline for other major projects.
     Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth and our financial health continues to strengthen.
     We remain focused on reducing cost which enables rapid investments in future programs and growth.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And I think also our Director of Energy Operations Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
     Kunal Girotra

Hi, everyone.
     My name is Kanal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying our energy products.
     I now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams.
     Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage businesses.
     As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50% over last quarter, and our energy storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.
-----
13. [Sentence #668, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
     We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.
     We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
>>> While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
     So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
     I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
     RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
     First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
     Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and solar.
     Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity.
-----
14. [Sentence #37, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PILOT]
     Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.
     Regarding Gigafactory, Shanghai, this month we started with trial production at Giga Shanghai and built four vehicles from body, to paint, to general assembly.
     So this is a -- more emphasis this is a real factory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it.
     While a lot of people see the outside show the factory, which is enormous, and it was essentially under water in January.
     It was below the water table literally.
     What is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive stamping machines, fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in the same period of time, in parallel with bogue building I'd like to thank our transient for this extraordinary achievement I'm not aware of any factory of this magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10 months.
     As far as I know, this is unprecedented.
     And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth.
     We're planning to build model-wise in Shanghai as well of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe and we hope to announce the location to that Gigafactory.
     In fact, we will announce the location to that Gigafactory before the end of this year.
     Regarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont, and we've moved the launch timeline from full 2020 to summer 2020.
     There may be some room for improvement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.
     I've actually recently driven the Model Y release candidate and think it's going to be an amazing product and be very well received.
>>> I think it's quite likely to -- just my opinion, but I think it will outsell Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.
     Regarding the Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month we released our latest Software Version 10, which includes video streaming games karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features and improvements.
     Most importantly, it includes the first version Smart Summon, which has now been used 1 million times.
     So, it's now over 1 million uses of Smart Summon, and in the next week or so we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon taking into account all the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.
     So, this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet, because it allows us to collect these corner cases and learn from them, and use street learning and become rapidly better just as Navigator and Autopilot did on the freeway.
     So, expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in the weeks to come.
     And this is really just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functionality get better.
     I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in early access release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving feature this year.
     So, it's not for sure, but it appears to be on track for at least an early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving by the end of this year.
     And yeah, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company, such as opening Gigafactories in other continents.
     Yes, it's worth noting that these geared ultimately having three Gigafactories effectively will triple out our output.
     And then when you consider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output over time.
     And then, there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and more efficient powertrains, and full self-driving and all that sort of stuff, but that will be something for a future time.
     And then, one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.
-----
15. [Sentence #217, TSLA_Q3_2019] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Now we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through windy roads and -- windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.
     That's the focus right now.
     You're going to want it all.
     That's the answer.
     Something everyone is going to want for sure.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Elon Musk

And as I said before, at the point which we're able to upload the software enabling a Tesla to become a robo-taxi, expect to have that from a functionality standpoint by the end of next year.
     In terms of the functionality -- basic functionality aspirationally end of this year but reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention in our opinion by the end of next year.
     And it would need -- the acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.
     But that transition, that sort of flipping the switch from a car that is from not robo-taxi to robo-taxi, I think, will probably be the biggest step change increase in asset value in history by far.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, with respect to Model Y, what is your latest expectations for launch timing?
>>> Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch?
     And how should Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?
     Elon Musk

Well, we've talked about the launch time.
     What really matters is the timing to volume production where volume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week.
     And we're confident of reaching that point no later than the middle of 2020.
     Yeah, so from an interest standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere.
     Yeah, the body line is separate, the paint line is -- basically we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3.
     No, we do not expect any downtime.
     From a margin standpoint, Zachary, do you want to add anything?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, from a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than they are for Model 3, and this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs.
     The part that we've worked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y, and our steady state forecast for that program puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3.
     There will be ramp in efficiencies at first, of course, as we launch the program, but as it stabilizes with steady state production, we do expect that it will be a higher margin product.
     It's something that we're very excited about within the company.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
-----
16. [Sentence #508, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

The opposite.
     When we launched Model X, Model S sales increased.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, so that's the best comparison that we have.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     Let's go to the next question.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you for taking the questions.
     First, just wanted to ask a question on Giga III.
     You're targeting 3,000 units a week.
>>> But we saw with Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy.
     And you sort of ramp and then sort of cut production to fix the bottlenecks.
     Given this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should we expect production to be on a week-to-week basis?
     Meaning, once you hit the 3,000, is that 3,000 you could go every single week in a quarter or is it still going to be lumpy within a quarter?
     Elon Musk

I mean, if you've got a crystal ball, we'd love to use it.
     Dan Levy

I'm looking for it.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, it should be smoother than Model 3 because there's a lot of commonality of parts.
     But -- and I think if you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairly smooth.
     But from a week to week standpoint, it obviously will not be.
     It will be about as smooth as, say, the stock market.
     How smooth is the stock market from one week to the next?
     But if you just extend the time period to, say, two or three-quarters, it will be very rapid steady ground.
     And obviously it will go way past 3,000 a week.
     Dan Levy

Okay.
-----
17. [Sentence #1028, TSLA_Q3_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     We'll...

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Drew.
     Drew Baglino

Yes, we'll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call.
     Elon Musk

I mean, it's in that vicinity.
     Yes.
     We’re not far off.
     Pierre Ferragu

Thank you.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you.
     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
>>> Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
     With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
     Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
     Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
     But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
     It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target as Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
     But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
-----
18. [Sentence #24, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please press star one now if you would like to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter.
     The execution was outstanding and -- on just about every front.
     So it's just an honor to work with such a great team.
     Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter and we had record deliveries, we're able to make great strides and controlling our costs.
     We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash flow.
     And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their part to reduce cost.
>>> Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.
     Regarding Gigafactory, Shanghai, this month we started with trial production at Giga Shanghai and built four vehicles from body, to paint, to general assembly.
     So this is a -- more emphasis this is a real factory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it.

     I've actually recently driven the Model Y release candidate and think it's going to be an amazing product and be very well received.

     Drew Baglino

For Standard Range and Standard Range Plus customers, which is a big deal.
     Elon Musk

I don't think there's ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and it gets way better over time just through the software.
     Not a little bit better, but a lot.
     Drew Baglino

It's very exciting, I think.
     Yeah.
     As a customer myself, I enjoy these updates.
     I always look forward to them.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, might move the Model S range to almost 380 or high 370s with the update.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And we're not stopping to work there.
     We'll continue working on these developments.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, absolutely.
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, did you have a follow-up question?
     Pierre Ferragu

Yeah, just a quick one on the Model Y.
>>> So, I was wondering what you have learned with S and X that make you think maybe when you launch Model Y, you have some cannibalization of demand on the Model 3?
     And have you started to think about that and how to approach it?
     Elon Musk

No, I don't think.
     We're not expecting to see cannibalization of Model 3, one is a sedan and one is an SUV.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, the best comparison we have for that is when we launched Model X and we had Model S at the time.
     Elon Musk

Model S sales increased.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, and we didn't see any cannibalization there.
     Elon Musk

The opposite.
     When we launched Model X, Model S sales increased.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, so that's the best comparison that we have.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     Let's go to the next question.
     Operator

Thank you.
-----
20. [Sentence #665, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core business.
     On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin.
     Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
     We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
     We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year to over 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.
     We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
>>> As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
     While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.

     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.
     So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
     I'll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few comments.
     RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.

21. [Sentence #68, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     And so we're scaling up production of the Version 3 solar tower roof at our buffalo Gigafactory.
     And I think this product is going to be incredible.
     But we'll talk more about that on the official product launch, which will be tomorrow afternoon.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And I think Zachary has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, thank you, Elon.
     Thank you, Martin.
     Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla.
     I know many employees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.
     We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvements in nearly every aspect of the business.
     There are three key points I would like to highlight.
     First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved gross profit, reduced operating expenses and the absence of negative one-time items that weighed on our financials in the first half of the year.
     GAAP automotive gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.
>>> We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on Model S, Model X and Model 3, enabling better fixed cost absorption.
     We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import related items.
     We are also making continued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.
     Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimited supercharging.
     And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly, driven by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA.
     North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter, which is great to see.
     Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the US, we were able to recognize $30 million of deferred revenue.
     As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features, we will continue to recognize additional deferred revenue.
     Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve efficiency of this area of the business, and we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveries and new programs in development.
     And finally, on net income and other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange, which as I mentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.
     The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend.
     This has enabled year to date positive free cash flows for the company.
     Our cash balance increased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest quarter-ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.
     Specifically, on captive leases, we've received a number of questions on how these are funded.

     But that transition, that sort of flipping the switch from a car that is from not robo-taxi to robo-taxi, I think, will probably be the biggest step change increase in asset value in history by far.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, with respect to Model Y, what is your latest expectations for launch timing?
     Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch?
     And how should Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?
     Elon Musk

Well, we've talked about the launch time.
     What really matters is the timing to volume production where volume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week.
     And we're confident of reaching that point no later than the middle of 2020.
     Yeah, so from an interest standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere.
     Yeah, the body line is separate, the paint line is -- basically we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3.
     No, we do not expect any downtime.
     From a margin standpoint, Zachary, do you want to add anything?
>>> Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, from a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than they are for Model 3, and this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs.
     The part that we've worked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y, and our steady state forecast for that program puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3.
     There will be ramp in efficiencies at first, of course, as we launch the program, but as it stabilizes with steady state production, we do expect that it will be a higher margin product.
     It's something that we're very excited about within the company.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And the last question from institutional investors is, can you provide an update on FSD package attach rates?
     As FSD attach rates improve, will you let the financial benefits manifest in higher gross margins for company and shareholders or will you lower the price to drive delivery volume?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

I don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD.
     I expect the price of FSD to increase slowly as the functionality and capability improve.
     That's -- that is unchanged.
     Anything to add on to that?
     I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross margin because of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates.
     So that's why I think it's in the order of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue.

23. [Sentence #302, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     And then, there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we think the car is safe enough to be driven without supervision.
     Then the third level would be that regulators are also convinced that the car can be driven autonomously without supervision.
     Those are three different levels.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     Sherry, we can now go to the questions from analysts.
     Operator

Thank you.
     [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.
     Dan Galves

Hey, guys.
     Thanks for taking my question.
     I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the auto gross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2, particularly you mentioned some nonrecurring items in the letter.
     And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plant comes up, but isn't at full production yet?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I can provide a couple of comments on that.
>>> On your final -- on your last question about China headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory.
     So we don't expect China to be any different than that.
     So there will be some that we experience in Q4.
     The amount of that is hard to forecast, given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here in Fremont.
     We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly fixed cost absorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.
     On the margin improvement, a couple of things there for Auto gross margin.
     As I mentioned in my opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3.
     I mean, that's important, as I mentioned in the last earnings call.
     The prior powertrain versions of S and X provided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.
     We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand.
     And so, I think there is a bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.
     And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us.
     It's hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company.
     And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there.
-----
24. [Sentence #1039, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     Thank you.
     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
     Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
     With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
     Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
     Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
>>> But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
     It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target as Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
     But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
     And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont and S and X margins.
     So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     Thanks.
     And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
     And I think your strategy generally has been, you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate the extra volume.
     And I think that's what we're seeing in China and the use of LFP, that's a good example.
     So once you ramp in Berlin, what's the reasonable expectation of what pricing might look like in Europe?
     And how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental reg credit?
     So margins out of the gate that are a little low, but are then used for the reg credits that help to offset that.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

     So that's why I think it's in the order of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue.
     So if you were to include that, which is obviously recognized as we release the full self-driving functionalities, the actual gross margin we're operating in on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.

     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you for taking the questions.
     First, just wanted to ask a question on Giga III.
     You're targeting 3,000 units a week.
     But we saw with Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy.
     And you sort of ramp and then sort of cut production to fix the bottlenecks.
     Given this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should we expect production to be on a week-to-week basis?
     Meaning, once you hit the 3,000, is that 3,000 you could go every single week in a quarter or is it still going to be lumpy within a quarter?
     Elon Musk

I mean, if you've got a crystal ball, we'd love to use it.
     Dan Levy

I'm looking for it.
>>> Elon Musk

Yeah, it should be smoother than Model 3 because there's a lot of commonality of parts.
     But -- and I think if you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairly smooth.
     But from a week to week standpoint, it obviously will not be.
     It will be about as smooth as, say, the stock market.
     How smooth is the stock market from one week to the next?
     But if you just extend the time period to, say, two or three-quarters, it will be very rapid steady ground.
     And obviously it will go way past 3,000 a week.
     Dan Levy

Okay.
     Great.
     Thank you.
     And then, just a follow-up.
     You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in your comments that one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy, and I think we understand the part that one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of resources away from Energy to the Auto side.
     Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets of growth in Energy, is it Solar or Storage?
     And now that you can reallocate resources, what would that entail in terms of capacity?
-----
27. [Sentence #332, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     So we'll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
     George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
     This is George Dailey on for Adam.
     So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model 3 sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it's a good question.
     At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory.
     There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down.
     And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering.
     So I think just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of the Fremont facility.
     George Dailey

Great.
     And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it's been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don't even offer one right now.
>>> As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?
     Elon Musk

Yeah, I think there's -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
     So it's something we're open to.
     As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
     And we're definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question, please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.
     Maynard Um

Hi.
     Thank you.
     I have two questions.
     The first is, Software Version 10.0 added a lot of functionality that's never really been available in a car before through an over-the-air update.
-----
28. [Sentence #72, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PLAN]
     And I think Zachary has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, thank you, Elon.
     Thank you, Martin.
     Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla.
     I know many employees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.
     We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvements in nearly every aspect of the business.
     There are three key points I would like to highlight.
     First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved gross profit, reduced operating expenses and the absence of negative one-time items that weighed on our financials in the first half of the year.
     GAAP automotive gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.
     We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on Model S, Model X and Model 3, enabling better fixed cost absorption.
     We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import related items.
     We are also making continued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.
     Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimited supercharging.
>>> And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly, driven by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA.
     North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter, which is great to see.
     Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the US, we were able to recognize $30 million of deferred revenue.
     As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features, we will continue to recognize additional deferred revenue.
     Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve efficiency of this area of the business, and we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveries and new programs in development.
     And finally, on net income and other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange, which as I mentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.
     The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend.
     This has enabled year to date positive free cash flows for the company.
     Our cash balance increased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest quarter-ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.
     Specifically, on captive leases, we've received a number of questions on how these are funded.
     We use our leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash.
     What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow, and as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow.
     This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rate increased substantially by 50%.
     In addition, CapEx spend increased, driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Y spending.
-----
29. [Sentence #609, TSLA_Q3_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     It's not like the obvious stuff.
     Obvious stuff you can do in simulation.
     But weird corner cases, only a reality can give you that.
     So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then train against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.
     And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
     There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.
     So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.
     That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
     Then in terms of capacity build out.
     We're making progress on three major factories.
     We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team.
     It is just, I mean, incredibly good.
     Super smart, work hard.
>>> It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.
     It's beyond all reasonable expectations.
     And then we're under construction in Berlin and Austin.
     So we're also making good progress there.
     Yes.
     It’s good.
     So it’s overall going well.
     I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year.
     But because of the exponential nature of the spool up of manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start off very slow at first and then become very -- afterward will become very large.
     Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve and I think, some of those people kind of spend a lot of time manufacturing kind of things that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it's at capacity.
     But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity.
     And that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology.
     So yes, I'd say, 12 to 24 months even.
     So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time.
-----
30. [Sentence #32, TSLA_Q3_2019] [PILOT]
     The execution was outstanding and -- on just about every front.
     So it's just an honor to work with such a great team.
     Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter and we had record deliveries, we're able to make great strides and controlling our costs.
     We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash flow.
     And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their part to reduce cost.
     Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.
     Regarding Gigafactory, Shanghai, this month we started with trial production at Giga Shanghai and built four vehicles from body, to paint, to general assembly.
     So this is a -- more emphasis this is a real factory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it.
     While a lot of people see the outside show the factory, which is enormous, and it was essentially under water in January.
     It was below the water table literally.
     What is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive stamping machines, fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in the same period of time, in parallel with bogue building I'd like to thank our transient for this extraordinary achievement I'm not aware of any factory of this magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10 months.
     As far as I know, this is unprecedented.
     And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth.
>>> We're planning to build model-wise in Shanghai as well of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe and we hope to announce the location to that Gigafactory.
     In fact, we will announce the location to that Gigafactory before the end of this year.
     Regarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont, and we've moved the launch timeline from full 2020 to summer 2020.
     There may be some room for improvement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.
     I've actually recently driven the Model Y release candidate and think it's going to be an amazing product and be very well received.
     I think it's quite likely to -- just my opinion, but I think it will outsell Model S, Model X and Model 3 combined.
     Regarding the Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month we released our latest Software Version 10, which includes video streaming games karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features and improvements.
     Most importantly, it includes the first version Smart Summon, which has now been used 1 million times.
     So, it's now over 1 million uses of Smart Summon, and in the next week or so we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon taking into account all the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.
     So, this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet, because it allows us to collect these corner cases and learn from them, and use street learning and become rapidly better just as Navigator and Autopilot did on the freeway.
     So, expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in the weeks to come.
     And this is really just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functionality get better.
     I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in early access release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving feature this year.
     So, it's not for sure, but it appears to be on track for at least an early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving by the end of this year.
