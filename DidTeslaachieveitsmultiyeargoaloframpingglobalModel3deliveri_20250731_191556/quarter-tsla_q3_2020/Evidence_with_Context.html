America, Europe, and China?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">125</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r2">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r2">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.
    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
    In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and 
Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r2">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r2">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r2">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r2">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r2">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
    As were previous investments in Model <span class="r2">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r2">2</span> billion to $<span class="r2">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and </span>
<span class="r4">location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai and</span>
<span class="r4">Model Y in Fremont.</span>
    Financing cash flows were $<span class="r2">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span class="r2">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span class="r2">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r2">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r2">500</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
    While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it&#x27;s possible with tight execution across the company.
    So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
    I&#x27;ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few 
comments.
    RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
    First, I&#x27;d like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
    Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we&#x27;re poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and 
solar.
    Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as 
the product reaches full capacity.

    Yes.
    We’re not far off.

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.
    Please go ahead.
    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you.
    Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> gross margin was in the </span>
<span class="r4">quarter relative to Fremont Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">?</span>
    And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
    Or was there also FSD revenues?
    Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
    It&#x27;s not particularly material in the $<span class="r2">10</span> million range for the quarter.
    With respect to product margins, what we&#x27;re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really 
across every product.
    Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
    Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
    But we&#x27;ve guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> built in Fremont costs.
    It&#x27;s not quite there, and it&#x27;s also a bit of a moving target as Model <span class="r2">3</span> Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to
come down with that.
    But we&#x27;re generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">122</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I think it&#x27;s reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core
business.
    On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from <span class="r2">18.7</span>% to <span class="r2">23.7</span>%, with some of 
our programs achieving greater than <span class="r2">25</span>% gross margin.
    Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r2">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r2">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.

    And not too far off of this, we&#x27;re seeing strength in Model <span class="r2">3</span> Fremont and S and X margins.
    So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    Thanks.
    And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
    And I think your strategy generally has been, you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate 
the extra volume.
    And I think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing in China and the use of LFP, that&#x27;s a good example.
    So once you ramp in Berlin, what&#x27;s the reasonable expectation of what pricing might look like in Europe?
    And how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental reg credit?
    So margins out of the gate that are a little low, but are then used for the reg credits that help to offset that.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

    It&#x27;s not like the obvious stuff.
    Obvious stuff you can do in simulation.
    But weird corner cases, only a reality can give you that.
    So that&#x27;s -- but we&#x27;re able to say, okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for 
examples, so we can then train against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.
    And it&#x27;s also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
    There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.
    So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you&#x27;re in a place 
that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a 
person.
    That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
    Then in terms of capacity build out.
    We&#x27;re making progress on three major factories.
    We&#x27;re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team.
    It is just, I mean, incredibly good.
    Super smart, work hard.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.</span>
    It&#x27;s beyond all reasonable expectations.
    And then we&#x27;re under construction in Berlin and Austin.
    So we&#x27;re also making good progress there.
    Yes.
    It’s good.
    So it’s overall going well.
    I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next 
year.
    But because of the exponential nature of the spool up of manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it
will start off very slow at first and then become very -- afterward will become very large.
    Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve and I think, some of those people kind of spend a lot of time 
manufacturing kind of things that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it&#x27;s at capacity.
    But it will typically take about <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months to reach capacity.
    And that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology.
    So yes, I&#x27;d say, <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">24</span> months even.
    So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">63</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    It&#x27;s the same thing for autonomy.
    Having on the order of <span class="r2">1</span> million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner case 
situations that you just can&#x27;t even come up with in simulation.
    This is the thing that is really valuable.
    It&#x27;s not like the obvious stuff.
