So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.

    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, to date, over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production in Texas increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck cell with </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.</span>
    This quarter we convert to building a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> of the Texas <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
