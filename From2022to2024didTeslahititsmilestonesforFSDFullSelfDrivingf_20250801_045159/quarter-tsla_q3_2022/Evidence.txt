6. [Sentence #317]  Any update on **full** self-driving?
7. [Sentence #538]  Elon Musk

We’ll achieve **full** self-driving **full** autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%.
8. [Sentence #541]  But anyone who’s driving **full** self-driving cars -- has **full** self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.
