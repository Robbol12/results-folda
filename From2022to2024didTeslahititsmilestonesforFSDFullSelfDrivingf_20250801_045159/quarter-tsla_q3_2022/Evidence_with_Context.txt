[TSLA_Q3_2022] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #34] [PILOT]
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
     So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
>>> So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.
     We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road.

2. [Sentence #28] [PILOT]
     And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000.
     Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
     We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell.
     And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.
     We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
     Colin, go ahead and unmute.
     Colin Langan

Can you hear me now?
     Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
     Colin Langan

Okay.
     Sorry about that.
>>> Any update on full self-driving?
     I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year.
     Is that still possible?
     Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you’re talking about?
     And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you’d have to think about?
     Elon Musk

We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year.
     So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval.
     It won’t have regulatory approval at that time.

4. [Sentence #136] [PLAN]
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
     We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
     At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.

     Thank you.
     And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
     William Stein

I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors.
     FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
     Elon Musk

We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%.
     And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there.
     And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control.
>>> But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement.
     You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there.
     In fact, we almost are there.
     And so, we’re probably -- achieving that 100%.
     The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, 100%.
     Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs.
     So the jury is out on Dojo.
     Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training.

7. [Sentence #538] [PLAN]
     No doubt.
     Elon Musk

We don’t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
