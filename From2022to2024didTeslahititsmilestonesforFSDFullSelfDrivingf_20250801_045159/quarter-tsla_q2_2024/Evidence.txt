[TSLA_Q2_2024] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #26]  Regarding **Full** Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with **Full** Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised **full** self-driving works.
2. [Sentence #54]  Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised **FSD** essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
3. [Sentence #77]  Since the revision of **FSD** pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
4. [Sentence #109]  Elon Musk

I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised **full** self-driving.
5. [Sentence #167]  Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license **FSD**?
6. [Sentence #168]  Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla **full** self-driving.
7. [Sentence #175]  It's been actually helpful in advancing **full** self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center.
8. [Sentence #274]  I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on **FSD**.
9. [Sentence #343]  So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised **FSD** in Europe, China, and other countries.
10. [Sentence #368]  Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular **FSD** on a traditional Tesla vehicle.
