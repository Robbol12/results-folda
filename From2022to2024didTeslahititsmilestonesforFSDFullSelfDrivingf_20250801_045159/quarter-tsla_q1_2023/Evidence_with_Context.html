Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.

Thank you.
    Maybe on the dramatic change we&#x27;ve seen in EV-related commodity prices.
    Do you think it&#x27;s a reflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining, or is that sort of a coincident 
indicator on global EV demand?
    And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next several quarters?
