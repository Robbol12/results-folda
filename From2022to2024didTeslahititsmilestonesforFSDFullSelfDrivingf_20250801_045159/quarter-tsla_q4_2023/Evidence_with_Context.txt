[TSLA_Q4_2023] From 2022 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #40] [PLAN]
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.
     This brings us to 2024.
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
     Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
     We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
>>> For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions.
     This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
     So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
     This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
     That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.
     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
     It's really quite remarkable.

     And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.

     Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
     Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old.
     So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.

4. [Sentence #227] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
     And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
>>> Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
     And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet.
     I think that will become obvious probably this year.
     And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology.
     It's definitely the smart move.

Thank you.
     The next question from Siddharth.
     What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting there?
