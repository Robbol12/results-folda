promised after its first full profitable year?

    Is it just the macro deteriorating?
    Is it the competitive landscape?
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
    And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed to adjustments we made in 
pricing in the second half of the quarter.
    I mean, I guess you could argue that that lowers the floor in a sense.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter.</span>
    So that brings it down further.
    About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring.
    So I mentioned these in my opening remarks.
    It&#x27;s a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced but not part of the pedigree of cars we&#x27;re 
building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we make some technology changes here that this deferral should get 
recognized once some of the software catches up.
    So those two things are not repeating.
    So hopefully, that helps answer your question.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.

    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
    And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more </span>
<span class="r5">stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.</span>
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
    I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.
    I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business.
    Relative to total revenues of the company, it&#x27;s still fairly small.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide.
    The length of the supply chain matters also because what we&#x27;re talking about is very far upstream.
    So by the time it makes sense that battery that ends up in car.
    It will be several months.
    But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we&#x27;re also very focused on other metrics that make
production very efficient.
    So, for example, detention and demurrage air expedites.
    I think our air expedites are down <span class="r2">90</span>%.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Detention and demurrage is down </span><span class="r5">93</span><span class="r5">% from the peaks.</span>
    That can be hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle.
    So we&#x27;re sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.
    Colin Rusch

Okay.
    And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
    I mean, obviously, there&#x27;s a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?
    And how much of that is converting into actual sales?

    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding </span>
<span class="r5">the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.</span>
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
    How frequently do you review pricing?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">34</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our energy storage deployment reached nearly </span><span class="r5">4</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt hours in Q1.</span>
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r2">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving 
beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">420</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    It will be several months.
    But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we&#x27;re also very focused on other metrics that make

    I think our air expedites are down <span class="r2">90</span>%.

    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?
    And how much of that is converting into actual sales?
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

I mean -- yes, I don&#x27;t -- that&#x27;s also not exactly how we look at it, really.
    We&#x27;re not like -- yes, we&#x27;re not engaged in the interconnection queue.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">71</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.

    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?</span>
    Elon Musk

My apologies.
    Sorry, I was on mute.
    Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
    Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some remarks as well.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">Thanks Martin.</span>
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">10</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">202</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Demand, obviously, isn&#x27;t the limitation.
    So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?
    Andrew Baglino

Sure.
    There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what&#x27;s going on in Lathrop.
    We actually had two phases of the CapEx there.
    We phased some of the general assembly parts of the facility.
    But in addition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side and on the 
power electronics side.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with both those inputs.</span>
    So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming online towards the end of this year.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Great.
    And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out of Shanghai.
    Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocate more vehicles to Southeast
Asia, Australia, other areas.
    I&#x27;m just wondering what other regions do you think you&#x27;re maybe not yet serving effectively?
    What are your timelines for addressing some of those gaps in your regional exposure?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">11</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">326</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?

recognized once some of the software catches up.
    So those two things are not repeating.
    So hopefully, that helps answer your question.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    I mean there&#x27;s really two macro factors that are tricky.
    The biggest being the interest rate.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">23</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r9">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s see.</span>
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.

features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">16</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">156</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
    And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, which is an input into 
our Austin COGS.
    And so, as the <span class="r2">4680</span> program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell 
portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
    A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
    It does not have <span class="r2">4680</span> as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.
    And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost 
reduction in the Berlin factory as well.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don&#x27;t need to rehash it, but the expectation is that </span>
<span class="r5">every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.</span>
    There&#x27;s also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we&#x27;re 
aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
    Within the world that we don&#x27;t control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in 
our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage 
of reduced spot rates where they can.
    So thank you to our supply chain team.
    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
    We think there&#x27;ll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but<span class="r10">...</span>

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.

    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.</span>
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.</span>
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r2">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving 
beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.

    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just a Q1 recap.
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.</span>
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
    How frequently do you review pricing?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">My apologies.</span>
    Sorry, I was on mute.
    Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">21</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">64</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher </span>
<span class="r5">volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.</span>
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business 
will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.
    We generally look to mid-<span class="r2">20</span>% gross margins for any program that we launch.
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.
    Elon Musk

We&#x27;re hopeful to get there later this year, but that&#x27;s not a promise.
    That&#x27;s an aspiration.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how well are <span class="r2">4680</span> cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?</span>
    Drew?
    Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
    So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down road map through <span class="r2">2026</span> across five areas of effort.
    There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack concept, and the cell 
factory itself, and we&#x27;ve been making progress across all of these aspects since then.
    For the cell factory, the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> factory are partway through building and commissioning and selling and 
operating will be <span class="r2">70</span>% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factories when fully ramped, in line with what we 
described on Battery Day.
    And we&#x27;re continuing to further pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory 
build-outs like in Nevada.
    On the cell design, we&#x27;re in production with not only the first generation tablet cell we unveiled on Battery Day, 
but a second more manufactural version in Texas today.

    On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Day road map.
    For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May.
    Our goal is to start commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year.
    The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic 
reagents, lower embodied energy.
    It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials.
    We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.
    Same with cathode precursor, we&#x27;ve successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process 
that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this
technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility.

    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Perfect.
    So, first question was on Lathrop.
    Obviously, that&#x27;s -- it&#x27;s great to see the growth there.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization?</span>
    Are you just sort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there?
    Demand, obviously, isn&#x27;t the limitation.
    So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?
    Andrew Baglino

Sure.
    There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what&#x27;s going on in Lathrop.
    We actually had two phases of the CapEx there.
    We phased some of the general assembly parts of the facility.

    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.

    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.
    So, there will be a like a Model <span class="r2">3</span> or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.
    So, yes, that&#x27;s -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
    And then maybe a question for Zach.
    Back on the automotive gross margins.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5">% automotive </span>
<span class="r5">gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.</span>
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
    Is it just the macro deteriorating?
    Is it the competitive landscape?
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
    And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?

    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r8">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r8">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r2">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving

factors of achieving full autonomy.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort </span>
<span class="r5">into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.</span>
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in
