    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from <span class="r2">2023</span> through <span class="r2">2024</span>, as it promised 
after its first full profitable year?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">202</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
    For <span class="r2">2025</span>, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span class="r2">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our free cash flow for the quarter was $</span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> billion, and despite capex increase of over $</span><span class="r4">2.4</span><span class="r4"> billion in </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4">, we were </span>
<span class="r4">able to generate free cash flow of $</span><span class="r4">3.6</span><span class="r4"> billion for the year.</span>
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span class="r2">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span class="r2">5</span> billion.
    And for <span class="r2">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.
    In conclusion, like Elon said, <span class="r2">2025</span> is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla.
    There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the 
pace for the next phase of growth.

    Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this resulted in -- but declined sequentially.
    This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in 
deployments year over year in <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the </span>
<span class="r4">business.</span>
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.

    For <span class="r2">2025</span>, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
