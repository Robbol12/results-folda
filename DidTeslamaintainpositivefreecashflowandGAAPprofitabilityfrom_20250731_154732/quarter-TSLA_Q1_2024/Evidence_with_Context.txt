[TSLA_Q1_2024] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2023 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

1. [Sentence #417] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Mark, is it helpful?
     Mark Delaney

Yes, very helpful.
     Thank you.
     My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward.
     Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place.
     Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
>>> And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
     Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.
     That’s true of any area.

     Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.
     We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.
     And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
     Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
     On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing, and other activities.
     We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
     The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute.
>>> We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
     In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding.
     Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
     And we can open it up to Q&A.

     That’s true of any area.
     So over time, we do need to keep making sure that we’re – that it’s a great product at a great price.
     And moreover, that price is accessible to people.
     So it’s not – you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question.

     On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
     We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products.
     Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.

     I'll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and that you can escape, we're talking terminator-level risk.
     And yes, I'd be uncomfortable with.
     If there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed.
     And if there's shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can't say that.
     That is a fact.
     They have an opportunity.
     And yes, we'll see.
>>> If the company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.
     Alex Potter

All right.
     That's actually all very helpful context.
     Thank you.
     Maybe one final question and I'll pass it on.
     OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there.
     I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions.
     What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks?

     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
>>> Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
     We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
-----
7. [Sentence #49] [PLAN]
     We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training.
     It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used.
     So, in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy road map.
     I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 and it tells that that it is only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that.
     And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future.
     And I'll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone.
     And that will become very obvious in hindsight.
>>> We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead.
     Thanks.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
     It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
     We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
     Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5%.
     Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality.
