[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2023 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #12]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
2. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record **profitability** for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
3. [Sentence #15]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us.
4. [Sentence #21]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck **cash** **flow** **positive**.
5. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be **cash** **flow** **positive** at a price that people can afford.
6. [Sentence #28]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach **positive** **cash** **flow**.
7. [Sentence #31]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant **positive** **cash** **flow** contributor.
8. [Sentence #34]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) **Free** **cash** **flow** remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
9. [Sentence #36]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining **positive** **cash** **flow** and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.
10. [Sentence #44]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of **profitability** in our energy business.
11. [Sentence #49]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead.
12. [Sentence #53]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) However, our focus is to continue making investments through **positive** **cash** **flow** from operations.
13. [Sentence #64]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending **free** **cash** flows.
14. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong **free** **cash** **flow** in spite of a very high interest rate environment.
15. [Sentence #68]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We are also making progress on storage **profitability**, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
16. [Sentence #71]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We had negative **free** **cash** **flow** of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
17. [Sentence #73]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and **free** **cash** **flow** to return to **positive** again.
18. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of **free** **cash** **flow** to end the year with over $29 billion of **cash** and investments on hand.
19. [Sentence #81]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Our 2023 **GAAP** net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-**cash** benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
20. [Sentence #94]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) We reverted to ****positive** **free** **cash** **flow**** of $1.3 billion in Q2.
21. [Sentence #117]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
22. [Sentence #124]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
23. [Sentence #156]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) Our Q3 results were **positive** and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating **cash** flows of $6.3 billion.
24. [Sentence #193]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Therefore, while we manage them to be **positive** on a **GAAP** basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business.
25. [Sentence #202]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) Our **free** **cash** **flow** for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite capex increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate **free** **cash** **flow** of $3.6 billion for the year.
26. [Sentence #314]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) So, I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment.
27. [Sentence #324]  (TSLA_Q2_2023) Elon Musk

Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have ****positive** **free** **cash** **flow**** in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology.
28. [Sentence #326]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) If the company generates a lot of **positive** **cash** **flow**, we could obviously buy back shares.
29. [Sentence #417]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay **free** **cash** **flow** **positive** on an annual basis with the current product set?
30. [Sentence #420]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) I think we can be **free** **cash** **flow** **positive** meaningfully.
