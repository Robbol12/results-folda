after its first full profitable year?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">53</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span class="r2">37</span>,<span class="r2">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
    On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot 
production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.</span>
    This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately <span class="r6">[</span>$<span class="r2">8.9</span> billion<span class="r6">]</span> <span class="r6">(</span>ph<span class="r6">)</span> and free cash flows of
approximately $<span class="r2">2.3</span> billion.
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.

    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r2">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best</span>
<span class="r5">product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price </span>
<span class="r5">that people can afford.</span>
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span class="r2">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

    I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
    The demand is off the charts.
    We have over <span class="r2">1</span> million people who’ve reserved the car.
    So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, 
insanely difficult things.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to 
target -- expect to have around <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.
    The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it 
comes to real world AI.
    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.

    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r2">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
    Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver <span class="r2">2.3</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2024</span>, representing <span class="r2">28</span>% growth 
versus <span class="r2">2023</span> guidance.
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when does Tesla expect to return to its </span><span class="r5">50</span><span class="r5">% long-term CAGR?</span>
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r2">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
    I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.
    Martin Viecha

    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span class="r2">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company</span>
<span class="r5">in the world by far.</span>
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
