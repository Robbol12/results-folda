[Year Q3] Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from 2023 through 2024, as it promised after its first full profitable year?

1. [Sentence #53, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PILOT]
     As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades.
     This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
     Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500.
     We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
     Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
     On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.
     We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.
>>> However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
     This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion.
     Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
     Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet.
     As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
     And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
     We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
     However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.

2. [Sentence #23, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
>>> So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
     That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
     People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
     And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.
     But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.
     That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla.
     So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

     So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
>>> It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor.
     I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
     The demand is off the charts.
     We have over 1 million people who’ve reserved the car.
     So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things.
     In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.
     The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.
     I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.

     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.

     And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world and probably by a long shot.
     I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future.
     Thank you.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much, Elon.
     And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
>>> Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion.
     Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
     While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing incentives.
     As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
     We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter.
     We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year.
     To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
     And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.

     So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
     So, this is big deal.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.?
     I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
     So let’s go to the next one.
     Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.
     Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024?
>>> And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
     Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.
     I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
     So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe.
     I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, to recap, as someone was saying, something that what -- the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3.
     Tesla, at the same time, has achieved record deliveries.
     In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable.
     And I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company that is profitable.
>>> So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us.
     So, we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla.
     That's staggering the immense amount of work to make 7 million cars.
     So, you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.
     And as you all know, on October 10, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot.
     And we had 50 autonomous vehicles.
     There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Ys, operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of people with no incidents the entire night.
     And all those who went there that worth emphasizing that the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator panels, meaning there was no way for anyone to intervene manually a unit if they wanted to and the whole night went very smoothly.

10. [Sentence #12, TSLA_Q3_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12.
     This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
     Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
     The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
     And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
>>> And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.

>>> Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business.
     Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
