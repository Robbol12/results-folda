    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> Did Tesla maintain positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability from <span class="r2">2023</span> through <span class="r2">2024</span>, as it promised 
after its first full profitable year?

    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher </span>
<span class="r5">volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.</span>
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
    We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, 
in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.

    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
