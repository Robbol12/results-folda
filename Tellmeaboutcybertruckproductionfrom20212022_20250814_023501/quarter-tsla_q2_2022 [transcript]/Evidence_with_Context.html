    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
    Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.</span>
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.

    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

    Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
    But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
    So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done 
in the past where you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">120</span> different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and 
then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
    So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the 
master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact 
that there’s a casting.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right?
    Like we are not just evaluating the pack and insulation either, it’s the pack plus the body, the integration, do we 
have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount.
    And I think we’ve gone through one iteration.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re going to do another one with Cybertruck.</span>
    I mean, we’re taking the learnings and doing – the next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture.
    That’s certainly a target.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going?
    And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving have any significant impact on timelines or potential progress?
    Elon Musk

Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt.
    It’s irony.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
    As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.</span>
