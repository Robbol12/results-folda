[TSLA_Q3_2021] Between 2020 and 2024, did Tesla meet its guidance for year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage improvement?

1. [Sentence #363] [PLAN]
     And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here and it's uncertain how that will unfold.
     It's our hope that these things stabilize.
     Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict.
     And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.
     And so, we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.
     So, it's difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
     With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a Company on managing our overhead expenses and operating expenses.
>>> And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to happen.
     And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 of 5 quarters.
     As we think forward, the business up until this point is kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a little bit of software on top of that.
     As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there's considerable upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.
     So, we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, just a little bit difficult over the next 4 to 5 quarters.
     And we'll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.
     There's just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.
