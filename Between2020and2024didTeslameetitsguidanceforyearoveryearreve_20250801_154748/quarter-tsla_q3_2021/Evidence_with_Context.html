leverage improvement?

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be a part of our story here and it&#x27;s uncertain how that will 
unfold.
    It&#x27;s our hope that these things stabilize.
    Exactly when that happens is difficult to predict.
    And we have been adjusting pricing in line with those changes in cost.
    And so, we&#x27;ll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.
    So, it&#x27;s difficult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.
    With respect to operating margin, we&#x27;ve been very focused as a Company on managing our overhead expenses and 
operating expenses.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has been declining and I expect that trend to continue to happen.</span>
    And I think the net of all of this is hopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> quarters.
    As we think forward, the business up until this point is kind of largely been a hardware automotive business with a 
little bit of software on top of that.
    As full self-driving matures, as take rates increase, if we are to raise pricing on that, there&#x27;s considerable 
upside both on gross margins and operating margin as that comes to light, as the business starts to become more of a mix
of a hardware-based Company and a software-based Company.
    So, we feel optimistic about the journey -- very optimistic about the journey as we look over into the long term, 
just a little bit difficult over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> quarters.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to update on earnings calls as we learn more information.
    There&#x27;s just a lot of uncertainty in the world right now.

Thank you, Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
