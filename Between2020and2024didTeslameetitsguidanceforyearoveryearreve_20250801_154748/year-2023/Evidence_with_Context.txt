[Year 2023] Between 2020 and 2024, did Tesla meet its guidance for year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage improvement?

1. [Sentence #1271, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     I don’t think it’s nothing.
     But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
     So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
     So, this is big deal.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.?
     I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
     So let’s go to the next one.
>>> Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.
     Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024?
     And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
     Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.
     I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
     So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe.

     Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production.
     That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
     As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell.
     Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis.
     We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
     Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model?
     Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
     Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
     Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023.
     As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target margins.
     The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024.
     We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour today, actually.
     We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

3. [Sentence #1670, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits.
     And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted.
     I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.
     Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects.
     So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.
     This brings us to 2024.
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
>>> Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
     We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
     For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions.
     This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
     So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
     This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
     That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.

5. [Sentence #1001, TSLA_Q2_2023] [UNCERTAIN]
     It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today.
     Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week.
     If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish.
     If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
     Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
     The value is just tremendous.
     So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
>>> I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next analyst.
     The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Two questions from me as well.
     First, following up on the autonomy.
     So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD incrementally.
     What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates?

     Elon Musk

Same thing with Battery Day.
     So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce.
     But I think some kind of update would be good to do.
     I'll talk it over with the team, and yeah, I think we might do something later this year.
     Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people thinking of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.
     Adam Jonas

Maybe as a follow-up.
     Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into Western markets.
>>> As the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in Western markets?
     And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Well, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world.
     So I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established.
     Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.
     So they're extremely good.
     We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner.
