leverage improvement?

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">302</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">76</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And I think there is a way, just with back of the envelop math, to potentially justify it, where -- if Tesla&#x27;s 
ships, let&#x27;s say, hypothetically, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> billion or $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become Full 
Self-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> hours a week
to potentially an average of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> hours a week, if they&#x27;re capable of serving as robotaxi.
    So that&#x27;s like roughly a 5x increase in utility.
    But let&#x27;s -- even if you say like, okay, let&#x27;s just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not 5x as 
useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost 
entirely gross margin.
    So it would mean, it would be like if you made $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> million -- $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> billion worth of cars, it will be like having $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> 
billion of incremental profit basically from that because it&#x27;s just software.
    So --  on that, it&#x27;s like $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode.
    So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and 
nothing else, the cars with FSD.
    And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So in conclusion, while </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2020</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the beginning.</span>
    We think <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> is going to be even more exciting.
    And you don&#x27;t know what to expect in a given year.
    Obviously, last year, we did not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> many things we do not expect.
    But assuming that <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint I think it&#x27;</span>s going to be a great year 
for Tesla.
    We&#x27;ve got a ton of -- many great new products coming out.
    We&#x27;ve got factories that are -- advanced factories  set up production.
    It will also make it easier having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">312</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>

    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">probably one level.</span>
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
