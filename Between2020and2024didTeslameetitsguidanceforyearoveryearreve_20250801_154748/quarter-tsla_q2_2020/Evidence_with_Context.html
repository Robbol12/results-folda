    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.

    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beyond Model </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">313</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    It does both.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;ve…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.</span>
    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.
    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
    And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
    So I hear your point on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% and the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>%.
    We&#x27;re on a bit of a journey here, and we&#x27;re continuing to be partner .
    Toni Sacconaghi

Thank you.
    And if I could just follow-up, Elon, you&#x27;ve talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really trying to
drive EV adoption globally.
    So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make 
your cars more affordable and broader?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It feels like, historically, you&#x27;ve always picked the path of, I&#x27;d rather drive more growth and more adoption </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">because ultimately, that&#x27;s the mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">reductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that&#x27;s been an </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company has made.</span>
    So how do you personally think about that trade-off between, even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, 
wouldn&#x27;t you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy.
    I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially
almost everyone when you&#x27;re factoring in autonomy.
    But that was really a mega game changer, giga game changer.
    Yes.
    But I mean, it is important for people to distinguish between two things.
    There&#x27;s value for money that our product has; and then there&#x27;s affordability.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more 
detail on production plans?
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
    But we&#x27;re going to accelerate that.
    I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla to carry our own freight, probably mostly 
between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

And there&#x27;s nothing more rewarding than going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> cars an hour to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a day.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
