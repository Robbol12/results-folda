[TSLA_Q3_2022] Between 2020 and 2024, did Tesla meet its guidance for year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage improvement?

1. [Sentence #132] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

2. [Sentence #356] [UNCERTAIN]
     We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S. We manufacture the modules in the U.S.
     So, that’s a pretty thin.
     So yes, we feel confident that we’ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We’ll meet those thresholds..

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin Rusch

The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here.
>>> And I’m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it’s on the R&D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit.
     It’s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
     I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing.
     I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows.
     It’s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it’s growing much slower.
     So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.

3. [Sentence #358] [UNCERTAIN]
     So yes, we feel confident that we’ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We’ll meet those thresholds..

     So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.
     So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we’re seeing it.
     Elon Musk

Yes.

4. [Sentence #85] [UNCERTAIN]
     Thank you, everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
     On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%.
>>> Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.
     However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
     Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.
     Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.
     We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls.
     In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
     On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
     Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.
-----
5. [Sentence #107] [PLAN]
     On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above.
     This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.
     Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3.
     And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And let’s go first to the shareholder questions.
>>> The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?
     Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
     Do you want to add?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
     We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
     Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
     Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
-----
6. [Sentence #231] [UNCERTAIN]
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
     Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
     And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed.
     So I’m going to skip to the next one.
>>> Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?
     Elon Musk

Well, to be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine.
     So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the 1% point come in.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
     So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
     But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
-----
7. [Sentence #143] [UNCERTAIN]
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing...

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
     But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
     Yes.
>>> At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
     So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the cars.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
     I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
     And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
     There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.
     Just try one.
