Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>

    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.

The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I’m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it’s on the R&amp;D side or on the </span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit.
    It’s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing.
    I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the 
company grows.
    It’s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it’s growing much slower.
    So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">27.9</span>%.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.</span>
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">107</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end 
of the year, as noted, just above.
    This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit 
will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.
    Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what 
we saw in Q3.
    And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating 
margins.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you very much.
    And let’s go first to the shareholder questions.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax </span>

    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
    Do you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while 
also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
    Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well 
positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly 
possible to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.

    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
    And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed.
    So I’m going to skip to the next one.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, to be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine.
    So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>% point come in.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to 
actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
    So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
    But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- 
people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.

cars.

There’s always the latest Tesla.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
    I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
