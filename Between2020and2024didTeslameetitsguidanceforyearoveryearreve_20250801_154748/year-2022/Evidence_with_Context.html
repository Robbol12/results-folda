    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>

    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.

    This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side.
    With the Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at 
this point, five years old from the design point.
    And Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> coming and then Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> beyond that, where there are significant leaps.
    And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year.
    And we&#x27;re seeing just a lot of world-class AI talent join the company.
    There&#x27;s also the long-term potential of Optimus where we&#x27;re able to use our expertise in electric motors and power 
electronics, batteries and advanced manufacturing to be able to make a humanoid robot that is actually useful and can be
made at high volume with exceptional capabilities, because of the -- or robot AI that, where we take the -- because the 
car is like a robot on four wheels and Optimus is a robot on legs.
    But the -- as we get closer and closer to solving real-world AI, and we don&#x27;t see anyone even close to us in 
achieving this, the value -- I think, you appreciate this and a few others do, but most don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking 
about.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so -- but it&#x27;s -- this is the thing that has order of magnitude potential market cap improvement for Tesla.</span>

    And the next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
    Alex Potter

Can you hear me, guys?
    Martin Viecha

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes

Alex Potter

Okay, great.
    So a quick one on FSD.
    This, I guess, for Zach.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.</span>
    And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So what we&#x27;re aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let&#x27;s say, for argument&#x27;s sake if Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> can be, 
say, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>% safer than human, Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> might be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>% or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span>%.
    It will be Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> beyond that.
    But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
    But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> with Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> is quite significant.
    So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is for Zach.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I think it&#x27;s probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial 
disclosures.
    But I&#x27;m happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business.
    So, we&#x27;re currently at a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.
    We&#x27;re growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% a quarter, so it&#x27;s growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.
    And in the states in which we&#x27;re operating, on average, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17</span>% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla 
Insurance product.
    And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S. We manufacture the modules in the U.S.
    So, that’s a pretty thin.
    So yes, we feel confident that we’ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the 
year.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We’ll meet those thresholds..

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
    Colin Rusch

The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I’m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it’s on the R&amp;D side or on the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit.
    It’s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing.
    I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the 
company grows.
    It’s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it’s growing much slower.
    So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.
    Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner.
    Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y.
    We also recognized a onetime benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">288</span> million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the U.S.
CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined compared to the same period last year.
    The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions, more severely than the vehicle business.
    Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components 
for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter.
    OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce, driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and 
other items.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">%.</span>
    Note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&amp;D as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in 
early April.
    These costs will be in automotive costs going forward, given these factories are now producing customer sellable 
cars.
    Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower-than-planned 
production.
    Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding product financing, to nearly zero.
    Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2.
    First, we’ve lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns.
    Production is resuming at limited levels, and we’re working to get back to full production as quickly as possible.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to first investor question.
    And the first investor question is, Elon has historically provided FSD time lines with not optimal accuracy.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We love his optimism for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2022</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> release, but is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">own conclusions on progress being made?</span>
    Interventions per mile driven, or any other data?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I’ve ever been involved in, I’ve never really
seen more kind of false dawns or where it seems like we’re going to break through, but we don’t, as I’ve seen in full 
self-driving.
    And ultimately, what it comes down to is that to solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world 
artificial intelligence, which is -- which nobody has solved.
    The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes.
    And so, actually, when you think about it, in order to solve for full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and
cameras to a degree of capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.
    And I think we will achieve that this year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we&#x27;ll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the 
question, so <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and rent credits and then $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">47</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ASP across all models.
    And so two other comments I want to make on this.
    Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.
    And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices.
    As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we&#x27;re delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been
so long for so much of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.
    The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we&#x27;re most focused on what our operating
margin is.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">faster than the vehicle business and as we&#x27;re heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.</span>
    And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we&#x27;re 
primarily managing to now.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don&#x27;t is 
that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled
and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.
    So that&#x27;s actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a 
small percentage of cars don&#x27;t have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    So that means that there&#x27;s millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% gross margin.
    And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.
    And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.

    Thank you, everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle 
deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.
    On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">17.2</span>% with automotive gross margin at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">27.9</span>%.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.</span>
    However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.
    Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto 
gross margin would have been nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%.
    Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to 
profitability.
    We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at 
length on prior calls.
    In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.
    On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record 
volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products.
    Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a
negative impact on working capital.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
    So you have those three things, you can convert all of it to a fully sustainable situation many times over, 
actually.
    So, I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and our goal
at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible.
    So yeah, so we were obviously ramping up Megapack production.
    And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our - the goal output.
    So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry&#x27;s best operating margins.</span>
    As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer.
    But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength.
    And we&#x27;ll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1st Investor Day.
    And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year.
    Congratulations, guys.
    Martin Viecha

Thanks, Elon.
    And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.

    On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end 
of the year, as noted, just above.
    This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit 
will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.
    Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what 
we saw in Q3.
    And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating 
margins.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let’s go first to the shareholder questions.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each </span>

    Elon Musk

Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements.
    Do you want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while 
also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States.
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
    Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well 
positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly 
possible to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.

    So, it’s – manage price, frankly.
    But we have so much excess demand.
    That is really just not an issue for us.
    It might be an issue for some other companies but it is not an issue for us.
    Toni Sacconaghi

Okay.
    Thank you.
    Elon, I am just wondering, a question for you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla has obviously changed dramatically in the last </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years from near life or death to a company with consistent </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cash flow and industry-leading margins.</span>
    I am wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether you see that changing in terms of
your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> years or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> years.
    I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn’t be on calls unless there is something unusual and you have been on 
every call since then.
    I am wondering how<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

I do a lot of unusual things, let’s face it.
    Basically, if there is only good news, I won’t be on the call.
    But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I will be on the call – 
relatively speaking, if there is bad news.
    And we have this good news, then I won’t be on the call.
    But I am committed to the long – I mean I will work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance the cause of 
sustainability and autonomy.

    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
    Unidentified Company Representative

And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies.
    And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed.
    So I’m going to skip to the next one.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, to be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine.
    So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

It’s the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>% point come in.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to 
actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low.
    So, I think we have to be in a very good spot.
    But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- 
people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
    But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.</span>
    So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the 
cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there’s still latest Tesla.
    I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid.
    And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth.
    There’s nothing even close, in my opinion.
    Just try one.
