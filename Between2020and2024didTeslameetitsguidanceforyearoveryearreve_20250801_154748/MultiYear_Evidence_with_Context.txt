[Multi-Year Analysis] Between 2020 and 2024, did Tesla meet its guidance for year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage improvement?

1. [Sentence #132, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
     That is our goal.
     And we think that, that's the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
     And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
     So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
>>> To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
     And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

2. [Sentence #122, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
     Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
     I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
     And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
     In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is – will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
>>> So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.

3. [Sentence #117, TSLA_Q2_2023] [PLAN]
     So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
     What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
     For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
     Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
>>> I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
     And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.

     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.

4. [Sentence #49, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading-edge Alpha [indiscernible] driving the car.
     So let's see.
     On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X.
     Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
     And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range.
     And as a result, it had a 391 test.
     As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.
>>> And of course, we're not stopping there.
     We're looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
     For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we're underway casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
     In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
     I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
-----
5. [Sentence #200, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PILOT]
     So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
     So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
     And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of the year, as a subscription.
     So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
     That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
>>> Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
     Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
     Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years?
     This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
     Is 40% or more realistic target?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
-----
6. [Sentence #355, TSLA_Q4_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation of the past.
     If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
     Obviously that’s not steam engines.
     So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people's rights, as what is happening right now.
     I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great.
     They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
     But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
>>> This is not democratic.
     This is not freedom.
     Give people back their goddamn freedom.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Please go ahead.
-----
7. [Sentence #64, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
>>> While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
     And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
-----
8. [Sentence #197, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PILOT]
     It's a little bit over $600 million.
     And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
     And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
     So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
     So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.

     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is – will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.

11. [Sentence #312, TSLA_Q4_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's a big problem.
     Different conversations.
     Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
     Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
     I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     It's a fair question.
>>> I don't have any additional color to provide.
     So $8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we're managing it very closely.
     As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the end of Q1.
     So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
     And as we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months, and there's ups and downs to the liquidity.
     Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we're paying off.
     But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and then we'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in.
     So it does go up and down a little bit.

     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.
-----
14. [Sentence #38, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
     Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
     All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
     Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive and making them better and better.
     I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined.
     I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
     It’s the reason I say it's very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches.
>>> So, when you're searching something and you click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that.
     It's very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
     So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be able to drive through an intersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns.
     And we really feel we're -- I feel extremely confident that it would be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year.
     So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading-edge Alpha [indiscernible] driving the car.
     So let's see.
     On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X.
     Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
-----
15. [Sentence #511, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
     I'll do my best here.
     So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
     Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
     So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
     And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
>>> And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
     Even though it's increasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.
     And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential increase in gross margin.
     I haven't specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
     We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.
     And in particular, S and X gross margins continue to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed cost amortization.
     So there's good progress happening, both on the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for our products and production.
     And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross profit contribution to the company once we get through these inefficiencies, we get them on up and running again, we increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and continue to execute on cost reductions on our products, we feel very optimistic about that path going forward.
-----
16. [Sentence #28, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PILOT]
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
     After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
     In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
>>> Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
     We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.
     This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
     Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
     All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
     Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive and making them better and better.

Thank you very much.
     So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
     What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
     For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
>>> Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
     I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
     And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
     In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is – will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.

     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Please go ahead.
>>> Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
     Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume.
     How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3, what other factors should we think about?
     And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
     Elon Musk

Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     A couple of thoughts there for Y.
     The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
-----
19. [Sentence #203, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PILOT]
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
     And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of the year, as a subscription.
     So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
     That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
     Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
>>> Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years?
     This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
     Is 40% or more realistic target?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
     So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number.
     It's possible that is 40%.
     I would be very shocked, if it's less than 40%, even with force majeure Model 3.

Absolutely.
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
     And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of the year, as a subscription.
     So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
     That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
>>> Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
     Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years?
     This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
     Is 40% or more realistic target?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
     So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number.
     It's possible that is 40%.

     So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people's rights, as what is happening right now.
     I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great.
     They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
     But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
     This is not democratic.
     This is not freedom.
     Give people back their goddamn freedom.
>>> Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Please go ahead.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
     Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume.
     How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3, what other factors should we think about?
-----
22. [Sentence #87, TSLA_Q1_2022] [PLAN]
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
     We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
     Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
>>> We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.
     As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
     This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
     And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
-----
23. [Sentence #323, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     And as we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months, and there's ups and downs to the liquidity.
     Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we're paying off.
     But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and then we'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in.
     So it does go up and down a little bit.
     But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we're managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk.
>>> We only have two car factories right now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area, and the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars, all of S and X, and most of the 3 and all of the Y.
     So the extension of the shelter in place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, that in my opinion, and breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country, what the fuck?
     Excuse me.
     But outrage -- it’s an outrage.
     So -- but it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to many companies.
     And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not.
     And all peoples -- everything people have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real time.
     And we're going to have many suppliers -- or have many suppliers that are having super hard times, especially the small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people.

Thank you.
     Our first question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
     Please go ahead.
     Adam Jonas

Thanks everybody.
     I hope everyone's safe and healthy.
     I got one question, one follow-up.
     And I'd point out, I've had a root canal before, and I would agree, Elon.
>>> It was less painful than buying a car.
     Elon Musk

I mean, really, it's -- yeah, exactly.
     Adam Jonas

It's a big problem, actually.
     It's a big problem.
     Different conversations.
     Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
     Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
     I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.

25. [Sentence #137, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
     To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
     And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
>>> And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.
     And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

26. [Sentence #85, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.

     It's reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
     So it's really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
     So taking all those things that we've replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is just very exciting.
     And then you've got – if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other way around.
     So lots of options.
>>> Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
     So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
     So we're going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
     We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for 2020.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and most lending instead of selling them battery storage?

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
     A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
     We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
>>> This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
     It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
-----
29. [Sentence #150, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PLAN]
     And so we'll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
     In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?
     Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
     That's one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
     And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
>>> And we've talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
     So I think that there's clearly an uncertain future ahead.
     It's a bit of a bumpy road.
     But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
     Anything you guys want to add?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
     The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great.
     The other one that I would add is, it's always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.

30. [Sentence #54, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     And as a result, it had a 391 test.
     As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.
     And of course, we're not stopping there.
     We're looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
     For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we're underway casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
     In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
>>> I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
     So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
