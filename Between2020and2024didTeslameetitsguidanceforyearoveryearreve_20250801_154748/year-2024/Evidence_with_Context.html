Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.9</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1937</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; For </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.</span>
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.
    Our free cash flow for the quarter was $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion, and despite capex increase of over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.4</span> billion in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, we were 
able to generate free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.6</span> billion for the year.
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
    While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to 
get immediate benefits.
    The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span>.
    Accumulated AI-related capex, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion.
    And for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, we expect our capex to be flat on a year-over-year basis.

    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
    I think it&#x27;s really similar to Optimus.
    It&#x27;s going to be set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than any
other transportation you could have.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, at that point, when we&#x27;re at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla&#x27;s revenue.</span>
    Might be difficult to say how much.
    you want to add.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

No.
    I mean, I do think that Tesla Semi, again with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable.
    That we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America, that&#x27;s one of the limiting factors on transport.
    And people are human so they get tired and sometimes there&#x27;s -- I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because 
it&#x27;s a tough job.
    But because it&#x27;s a tough job, there&#x27;s not that many people that want to do it.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And that will be how cars work.
    You just summon the car using your phone, you get in, it takes you to a destination, you get out.
    Vaibhav Taneja

You don&#x27;t even think about it?
    Elon Musk

You don&#x27;t even think about it.
    Just like an elevator, it takes you to your floor.
    That&#x27;s it.
    Don&#x27;t think about how the elevator is working or anything like that.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And something I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet.</span>
    So you can think of like how Tesla, think of it’s like some combination of Airbnb and Uber, meaning that there will 
be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet.
    There will be some number of cars and then there&#x27;ll be a bunch of cars where they&#x27;re owned by the end user.
    That end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want, and they can decide if they want to 
only let the car be used by friends and family or only by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>-star users or by anyone at any time they could have the car 
come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like an Airbnb.
    You could rent out your guest room or not, any time you want.
    So as our fleet grows, we have <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span> million cars going to – <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span> million cars going to, eventually tens of millions of 
cars worldwide.
    With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data and you get 
this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google Search has the sort of flywheel, it&#x27;s very difficult to 
compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking and Google is getting that feedback loop.
    It’s the same with Tesla.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> would be using all the power of the sun, and Level <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, all of power of the galaxy, so we&#x27;ve got a long way to
go, long way to go.
    When you think of courtship terms, it becomes obvious that by far, the biggest source of energy is the sun.
    Everything else is in the.
    So, in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI.
    And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends.
    We think what we&#x27;re doing is the right approach.
    And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company 
in the world and probably by a long shot.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we&#x27;re looking </span>

    Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with 
generation of record operating cash flows of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6.3</span> billion.

    In the years come it&#x27;ll be over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million, then over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million.
    This is immense scale.
    And the car is able to operate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">7</span>, unlike the human driver.
    So, the capability to -- like, if there&#x27;s this basically instant scale with a software update.
    And now this is for a customer on fleet.
    So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet, 
or cancel that and bring it back.
    It can be used by the fleet all the time.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It can be used by the fleet some of the time, and then Tesla would take -- would share on the revenue with the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">customer.</span>
    But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on 
wheels.
    The -- I mean, then in addition we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be
added to the fleet.
    I guess that would be a bit more like Uber.
    But this would all be a Tesla network.
    And there&#x27;s an important clause we&#x27;ve put in, in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be 
used in the Tesla fleet.
    They cannot be used by a third-party for autonomy.

Okay.

    Maybe it&#x27;s at least double.
    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.

    And when we look back on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually 
works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S 
or the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> or Model Y.
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.

    And again, just to clarify, it&#x27;s not the work which we have to do.
    It&#x27;s the work which they have to do, which will take the time.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Mark, is it helpful?
    Mark Delaney

Yes, very helpful.
    Thank you.
    My follow-up was to better understand Tesla&#x27;s approach to pricing going forward.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">in place.</span>
    Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?
    And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis 
with the current product set?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
    Lars Moravy

I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut 
like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
    Elon Musk

Yes.

    That&#x27;s $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion a month at some point probably.
    But all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus.

    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on.
    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> vehicles?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
    So, we&#x27;re not giving up on Hardware.

All right.
    With that, we will move over to analyst questions.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> And the first question will be coming from Daniel Roeska from Bernstein.
    Daniel, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
    Daniel Roeska -- Analyst

Hey, good evening, everybody.
    It&#x27;s Daniel from Bernstein.
    Elon, Tesla&#x27;s share price clearly already includes quite a few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today, 
yet realizing what you call kind of difficult but achievable will take some time.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; What are you pushing the Tesla executive team to do differently now to accelerate the innovation in order to realize</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the value you described for the company?</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I mean, we&#x27;re, I think, working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month
-- certainly month over month.
    It&#x27;s often week over week.
    I spent a lot of time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team.
    I mean, I go where the problem is essentially.
    If something, this is unfortunate.
    Sometimes I don&#x27;t talk to Tesla executive team and like, hey, we don&#x27;t see you very often.
    That&#x27;s because your stuff is working awesome.
