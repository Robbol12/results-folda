    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.

    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
    I think it&#x27;s really similar to Optimus.
    It&#x27;s going to be set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than any
other transportation you could have.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, at that point, when we&#x27;re at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla&#x27;s revenue.</span>
    Might be difficult to say how much.
    you want to add.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

No.
    I mean, I do think that Tesla Semi, again with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable.
    That we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America, that&#x27;s one of the limiting factors on transport.
    And people are human so they get tired and sometimes there&#x27;s -- I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because 
it&#x27;s a tough job.
    But because it&#x27;s a tough job, there&#x27;s not that many people that want to do it.

Great.
    Thank you very much, Vaibhav.
    Now, we will move over to investor questions and we&#x27;ll start with say.com.

    Maybe it&#x27;s at least double.
    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, in conclusion, </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2025</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.</span>
    And when we look back on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually 
works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S 
or the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> or Model Y.
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.

    Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> vehicles?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla&#x27;s capex?</span>
    I think they&#x27;re referring to cost there.
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

They&#x27;re really asking the tough questions, aren&#x27;t they?
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I guess we haven&#x27;t started working on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> yet.
    We are still making software releases.
    We released the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12.6</span> release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it&#x27;s a significant improvement compared to 
what they had previously.
    People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.

    Elon, Tesla&#x27;s share price clearly already includes quite a few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today,

Well, I mean, we&#x27;re, I think, working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month
-- certainly month over month.
    It&#x27;s often week over week.
    I spent a lot of time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team.
    I mean, I go where the problem is essentially.
    If something, this is unfortunate.
    Sometimes I don&#x27;t talk to Tesla executive team and like, hey, we don&#x27;t see you very often.
    That&#x27;s because your stuff is working awesome.
