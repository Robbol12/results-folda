    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million units </span>

    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It does both.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;ve…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.</span>
    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.
    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
    And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
    So I hear your point on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% and the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>%.
    We&#x27;re on a bit of a journey here, and we&#x27;re continuing to be partner .
    Toni Sacconaghi

Thank you.
    And if I could just follow-up, Elon, you&#x27;ve talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really trying to
drive EV adoption globally.
    So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make 
your cars more affordable and broader?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It feels like, historically, you&#x27;ve always picked the path of, I&#x27;d rather drive more growth and more adoption </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">because ultimately, that&#x27;s the mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">reductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that&#x27;s been an </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company has made.</span>
    So how do you personally think about that trade-off between, even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, 
wouldn&#x27;t you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy.
    I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially
almost everyone when you&#x27;re factoring in autonomy.
    But that was really a mega game changer, giga game changer.
    Yes.
    But I mean, it is important for people to distinguish between two things.
    There&#x27;s value for money that our product has; and then there&#x27;s affordability.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> years?</span>
    This would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2030</span>.
    Is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more 
detail on production plans?
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
    But we&#x27;re going to accelerate that.
    I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla to carry our own freight, probably mostly 
between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2085</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1859</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And I think there is a way, just with back of the envelop math, to potentially justify it, where -- if Tesla&#x27;s 
ships, let&#x27;s say, hypothetically, $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> billion or $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> billion worth of vehicles, and those vehicles become Full 
Self-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> hours a week
to potentially an average of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> hours a week, if they&#x27;re capable of serving as robotaxi.
    So that&#x27;s like roughly a 5x increase in utility.
    But let&#x27;s -- even if you say like, okay, let&#x27;s just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not 5x as 
useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost 
entirely gross margin.
    So it would mean, it would be like if you made $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> million -- $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> billion worth of cars, it will be like having $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> 
billion of incremental profit basically from that because it&#x27;s just software.
    So --  on that, it&#x27;s like $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> trillion and the company is still in high-growth mode.
    So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and 
nothing else, the cars with FSD.
    And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So in conclusion, while </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2020</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> was a turning point for Tesla and in terms of profitability, we believe this is just </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the beginning.</span>
    We think <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> is going to be even more exciting.
    And you don&#x27;t know what to expect in a given year.
    Obviously, last year, we did not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> many things we do not expect.
    But assuming that <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&#x27;21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint I think it&#x27;</span>s going to be a great year 
for Tesla.
    We&#x27;ve got a ton of -- many great new products coming out.
    We&#x27;ve got factories that are -- advanced factories  set up production.
    It will also make it easier having a factory in Berlin, one, in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2095</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">probably one level.</span>
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">108</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.</span>
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    So we&#x27;ll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

And there&#x27;s nothing more rewarding than going from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span> cars an hour to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a day.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
    So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new 
Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most lending instead of selling them battery storage?</span>
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
    It&#x27;s not out of the question, but our brand is full.
    Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
    That&#x27;s not out of the question.
    Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
    And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you&#x27;ve got to store the power, stationary 
storage.
