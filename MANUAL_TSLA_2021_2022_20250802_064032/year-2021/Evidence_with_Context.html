    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.

    Yes.

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?</span>
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
    Martin Viecha

    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.

    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.</span>
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
