Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.

    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
