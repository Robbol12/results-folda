    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.</span>
    We ramped the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai to more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow 
rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.

    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
    Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we&#x27;re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X
are in production now and will be delivered in February.
    So we&#x27;ve been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
    And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
    The Model S Plaid, and we&#x27;re actually in production now, and we&#x27;ll be delivering next month.
