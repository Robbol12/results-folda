    Or was there also FSD revenues?

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
    It&#x27;s not particularly material in the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million range for the quarter.
    With respect to product margins, what we&#x27;re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really 
across every product.
    Shanghai continues to make good progress there.

    It&#x27;s not quite there, and it&#x27;s also a bit of a moving target as Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to

    So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We&#x27;re continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial 
metrics for Q3.
    Overall, we delivered just over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">240</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span>% higher than the same quarter 
last year.
    We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million cars towards the end of the 
quarter.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.</span>
    Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to 
ramp and deliveries of Model X.
    It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
    This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.

    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved </span>

    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
    So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
    We&#x27;ll continue to ramp that factory.
    And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
    Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
    But we&#x27;ve intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and 
ability to expand.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we&#x27;ll take Model Y at these factories.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to get to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week as soon as we can.
    And then we&#x27;ll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars per week at those factories.
    And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
    So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
    And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cars per year.
    We&#x27;re going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% annual growth rate.

    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other 
products.
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">in Fremont and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> in Shanghai.</span>
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.

    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">ahead of schedule.</span>
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">14</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">391</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> once we have </span>

    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason.
    What was the question again?
    Okay.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
    And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cost structure will converge.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.</span>
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% a month, from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> -- it was 
like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span>% by the end of this year, maybe more.

    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non-critical patent projects.
    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>

    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.

    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.</span>
    And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.

    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> in Shanghai is the dramatically </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.

    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> million per year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">probably, next year.</span>
    So I am not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.
    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">70</span> watts or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span> watts.
    So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> computers in a server room or something like 
that.

    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Thanks, Elon.
    So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>, as Elon had 
mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.</span>
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.

    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.</span>
    We ramped the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai to more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow 
rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.

    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.

    Our operating cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.

    As were previous investments in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the

    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.</span>
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.

Sequential market improvement – margin improvement.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because 
we&#x27;re having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
    I&#x27;ll do my best here.
    So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.</span>
    So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
    And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
    And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
    Even though it&#x27;s increasing quickly and approaching Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it still is below the average.
    And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential 
increase in gross margin.
    I haven&#x27;t specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
    We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.

Hi, good evening.
    Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is 
already positive at such low volume.
    How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, what other factors should we think about?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?</span>
    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.

    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.
    The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our 
existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
    Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack 
production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
    Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
    And we&#x27;re excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
    Financially, our auto gross margins reached <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30.5</span>% on a GAAP basis and just under <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span>%, excluding regulatory credits, 
which was our strongest yet.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.</span>
    The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the 
ramp of Model X.
    As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
    However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
    Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our 
financials.
    Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.
    Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this 
quarter.
    While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which
should help to compensate.

    Dan Levy

Hi good afternoon.
    Thank you.
    I&#x27;ll ask a question on quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy.
    Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin.
    Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
    You&#x27;re in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you&#x27;re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
    What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

    Just to start with the gross margin questions.

    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> and just despite </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">being a bigger car that weighs more.</span>
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
