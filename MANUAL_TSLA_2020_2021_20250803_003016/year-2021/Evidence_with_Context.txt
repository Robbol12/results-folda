     [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks.
     Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We're continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3.
     Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter, and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.
     We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.
>>> The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
     Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to ramp and deliveries of Model X.
     It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
     But based on demand, we're targeting to exceed historical production levels.
     We've also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
     This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
     Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
     It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
     So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
>>> And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.
     And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.
     The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
     And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we've also -- that factory had a different line design, more efficient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
     So, that has been helpful.
     If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model X.
     And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.

3. [Sentence #1157, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     And they're going to continue to push on that.
     As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there as well.
     So most recently, the ramp up to Model Y, which was our biggest contributor of volume in Q3.
     We'll continue to ramp that factory.
     And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
     Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
     But we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.
>>> And so, we'll take Model Y at these factories.
     We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.
     And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.
     And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
     So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
     And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.
     We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.
     Martin Viecha

Great.

     One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction related to Powertrain.
     But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make the math work on a $25,000 vehicle.
     So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
     Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
     Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
>>> Model 3 and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.
     But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much 60%.
     And the part costs money.
     So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
     When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
     So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be integrated into that.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.

     This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
>>> And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
     In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

     So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
     So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
     In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
     The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
     It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
     For Model 3 to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
     In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
>>> When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year.
     So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
     I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
     Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
     This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever existed.
     And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, simply real-world artificial intelligence.
     And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 watts or 80 watts.
     So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that.

     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Thanks, Elon.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of 2021, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
>>> First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
     For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of the transition.
     And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
     Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors and port capacities.
     While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
     We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
-----
9. [Sentence #1079, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.
     The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
     Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
     Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
     And we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
     Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29%, excluding regulatory credits, which was our strongest yet.
>>> This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
     The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.
     As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
     However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
     Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials.
     Note that we are also not yet recognizing additional revenue from the FSD Beta program.
     Supply chain challenges, including expedites, continue to provide cost headwinds, as was also the case with FX this quarter.
     While we are seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjusting pricing, which should help to compensate.

     You had to retrofit that to your need.
