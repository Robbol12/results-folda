    Or was there also FSD revenues?
    Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
    It&#x27;s not particularly material in the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million range for the quarter.
    With respect to product margins, what we&#x27;re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really 
across every product.
    Shanghai continues to make good progress there.

    But we&#x27;ve guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> built in Fremont costs.
    It&#x27;s not quite there, and it&#x27;s also a bit of a moving target as Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to
come down with that.
    But we&#x27;re generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
    And not too far off of this, we&#x27;re seeing strength in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Fremont and S and X margins.
    So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved </span>

    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.

    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>

    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">ahead of schedule.</span>
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">391</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> once we have </span>

All right.
    Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason.
    What was the question again?
    Okay.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
    And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cost structure will converge.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.</span>
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% a month, from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> -- it was

    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non-critical patent projects.
    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>

    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> in Shanghai is the dramatically </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.

    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.</span>

rapidly.
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.

    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service

    As were previous investments in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span>

    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion equity

    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.</span>
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.

Sequential market improvement – margin improvement.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because 
we&#x27;re having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
    I&#x27;ll do my best here.
    So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.</span>
    So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
    And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
    And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
    Even though it&#x27;s increasing quickly and approaching Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it still is below the average.
    And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential 
increase in gross margin.
    I haven&#x27;t specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
    We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.

Hi, good evening.
    Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is 
already positive at such low volume.
    How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, what other factors should we think about?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?</span>
    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.

    Dan Levy

Hi good afternoon.
    Thank you.
    I&#x27;ll ask a question on quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy.
    Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin.
    Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
    You&#x27;re in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you&#x27;re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
    What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.

    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> and just despite </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">being a bigger car that weighs more.</span>
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.

    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Model Y margin.</span>
    And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cost structure will converge.
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.

    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">positive.</span>
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.

    There&#x27;s probably <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>%, maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% more engineering required for the factory then for the product itself.
    So we&#x27;re certainly making progress.
    I mean, battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, you know, alien dreadnought version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span>, something
like that, starting to approach version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>.
    We&#x27;re getting way better at making cars.
    You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
    You&#x27;ll see that even more with Berlin.
    And we&#x27;re really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but the internals will be</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we&#x27;ve done to date.</span>
    Drew, would you like to add to that?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I was going to expand on that.
    I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and
complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from 
like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit.
    And we&#x27;re learning so much through doing that.
    Elon Musk

Vertical integration is extremely important to this.
    But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable 
product, it would look insane.

    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
    In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and 
Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.</span>
    Looking forward to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> billion to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
