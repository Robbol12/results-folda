     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
     With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
     Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
>>> Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
     But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
     It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target as Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
     But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
     And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont and S and X margins.
     So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     Thanks.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.
     We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
     The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
     So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
     Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
     And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
>>> And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
     They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
     And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
     And it's continuing to do more and more internally.
     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
     And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.

     And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.

There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.

6. [Sentence #26, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PILOT]
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
     Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
     After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
     In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
>>> Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
     Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
     We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.
     This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
     Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
     All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
-----
7. [Sentence #95, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
     This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
     And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
>>> Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
     Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
     While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.

     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
     A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
>>> We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
     This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
     It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
-----
9. [Sentence #391, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
     Elon Musk

It's good.
     We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
     So it's tax.
     It's not make the product worse.
     It's -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how we can make it lighter and simpler.
     And so it's -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
>>> But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].

10. [Sentence #983, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.

11. [Sentence #633, TSLA_Q2_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
     This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world.
     To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects.
     The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions.
     Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
     On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%.
     This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the various shutdowns.
>>> Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products.
     With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period.
     The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.
     Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million.
     While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.
     Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
     In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.

12. [Sentence #100, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
     Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.

     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
     More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
     Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
     The Tesla team has done a great job here.
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.

13. [Sentence #1810, TSLA_Q4_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I'd just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
     We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
     So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging 2020.
     So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
     So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3 billion on building new factories and other expenditures.
     We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
     Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
>>> We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
     We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
     We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
     We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings for Model Y.
     This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
     We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
     We're also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
     And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.

     And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
     Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X are in production now and will be delivered in February.
     So we've been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
     And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
     The Model S Plaid, and we're actually in production now, and we'll be delivering next month.

15. [Sentence #1258, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
>>> Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
     While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.

Thank you.
     So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
     Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
     After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
>>> In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.

Sequential market improvement – margin improvement.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
     I'll do my best here.
     So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
>>> Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
     So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
     And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
     And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
     Even though it's increasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.
     And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential increase in gross margin.
     I haven't specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.
     We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.

     Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Please go ahead.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
     Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume.
     How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3, what other factors should we think about?
>>> And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
     Elon Musk

Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     A couple of thoughts there for Y.
     The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
     So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3.
     And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
     So we started with deliveries of performance initially.

Hi good afternoon.
     Thank you.
     I'll ask a question on quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy.
     Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin.
     Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter?
>>> And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3?
     And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
     You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
     What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
     And what your Texas factory is going to be?
     Thank you.

     We're looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and all those details that make Tesla special.
     For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we're underway casting that we are going to be making a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
     In fact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
     So, we're really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
     I'm very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
     It's better in every way essentially.
     For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
>>> So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model 3 and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.

Okay.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
     Please go ahead.
     Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
>>> Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is already positive at such low volume.
     How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model 3, what other factors should we think about?
     And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
     Elon Musk

Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     A couple of thoughts there for Y.
     The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
     So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3.

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you.
     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
>>> Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.

23. [Sentence #981, TSLA_Q2_2020] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Thank you.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Just to start with the gross margin questions.
     We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
     The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
     So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
     Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
>>> And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin.
     And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
     They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
     And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
     And it's continuing to do more and more internally.
     But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.

     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
     And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.

     There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factory then for the product itself.
     So we're certainly making progress.
     I mean, battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, you know, alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that, starting to approach version 1.
     We're getting way better at making cars.
     You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
     You'll see that even more with Berlin.
     And we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.
>>> The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date.
     Drew, would you like to add to that?
     Drew Baglino

Yes.
     I was going to expand on that.
     I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit.
     And we're learning so much through doing that.
     Elon Musk

Vertical integration is extremely important to this.
     But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane.

     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
>>> As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
     While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
