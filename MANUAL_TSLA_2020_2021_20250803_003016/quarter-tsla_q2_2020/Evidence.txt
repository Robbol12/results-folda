[TSLA_Q2_2020] model-y; model y; cost of model y; cost of model-y

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #101]  Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai.
2. [Sentence #200]  The fundamental architecture of [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date.
3. [Sentence #437]  And give us an idea of how far [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3?
4. [Sentence #448]  [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow], as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
5. [Sentence #449]  And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] margin.
6. [Sentence #450]  And as we said before, the [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge.
7. [Sentence #451]  They're not quite there, [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production.
8. [Sentence #452]  And with [white on yellow]Model Y[/white on yellow] carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
