    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.

    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non-critical patent projects.
    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>

    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.

    Please go ahead.
    Dan Levy

Hi good afternoon.
    Thank you.
    I&#x27;ll ask a question on quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy.
    Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin.
    Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">?</span>
    And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
    You&#x27;re in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you&#x27;re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
    What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.

    You can see that in Giga Shanghai.
    You&#x27;ll see that even more with Berlin.
    And we&#x27;re really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we&#x27;ve done to date.</span>
    Drew, would you like to add to that?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I was going to expand on that.
    I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and
complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from 
like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit.
    And we&#x27;re learning so much through doing that.

Vertical integration is extremely important to this.
    But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable 
product, it would look insane.
