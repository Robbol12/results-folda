And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?</span>

    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.

    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?

    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
    You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% per year or better.
    That would put you at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.2</span> million vehicles or more in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.

million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, or how do we think about that or what else is 
missing in that equation?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, it&#x27;s apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
    If an asset has <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times more utilization than the -- it&#x27;s like dividing the cost of that asset by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>.
    So, if you have a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car, it&#x27;s like having a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because 
still you don&#x27;t want to drive.
    So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
    So, it&#x27;s probably better than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times, I don&#x27;t know.

    And so, -- and the value of that will be a very big number.
    I just look at this as asset utilization.
    You have a passenger car, which normally is driven maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> 
hours a week, a lot of cars are in parking lots.
    So, we&#x27;re spending money, not just driving the cars but storing them all over the place.
    We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.
    But there will be a challenge with traffic.
    So, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, and now I think 
it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because
you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of 
cars on the road.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean, it&#x27;s going to be -- I think it&#x27;s way cheaper to draw a price point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Tesla, which every car we&#x27;ve made in the past three or four years will be capable of that, than a bus or a subway, will </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.</span>
    So, if we want to get -- I&#x27;m not going to take the bus.
    If it costs you -- I don&#x27;t know for arguments sake $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> to travel <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> miles point to point, taking the bus, especially 
in cold weather or dark or maybe a little bit dangerous or that.
    I just do not understand how profound change this is.
    It&#x27;s not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
    Millions of cars suddenly have about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> or <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times utility  overnight.

    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.</span>
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
