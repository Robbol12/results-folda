[TSLA_Q3_2023] tesla cost of cybertruck from 2021-2023

1. [Sentence #68] [PLAN]
     To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month.
     In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform.
     We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
     Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now let’s go to investor questions.
     The first investor question comes from Craig.
>>> How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
     Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
     Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
     And like I said, there’s no way around that.
     If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not that hard.
     But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
     You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
     So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
-----
2. [Sentence #17] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, interesting to think about that.
     We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
     And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.
     If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is.
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
>>> The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
     I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

3. [Sentence #21] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
     And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
     Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.
     The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
     I am too.
     I’ve driven the car.
     It’s an amazing product.
>>> I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
     This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
     So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford.
     Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
     That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
     People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
     And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype.
     But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow.

4. [Sentence #411] [PLAN]
     And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the line.
     Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
     Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
     That would also bring some savings from higher production.
>>> But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.
     So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
     And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over 15 pounds right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
     You’re still fat.
     So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
     That’s the actual way.

5. [Sentence #215] [UNCERTAIN]
     I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.
     But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering.
     I have been through it many times.
     Then, here we go again.
     Will Stein

Similar path for the next-gen platform?
     Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.
     I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.
     Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.
     And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.
     And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous.
     It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.
     So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.

6. [Sentence #91] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter.
     Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 million cell off of line one.
     Texas is now our primary 4680 facility.
     We’re heavily focused on quality.
     Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter.
     With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
     And that is our priority.
>>> The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.
     This quarter we convert to building a 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three quarters.
     Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction.
     The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024.
     Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
     Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
     A – Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from institutional investors.

     Then, here we go again.

     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.

     So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
     Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
     In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck.
     I think it will be quite a fast ramp.
     As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.

8. [Sentence #297] [PLAN]
     So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
     There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
     We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
     So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
     Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
     We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
     So, they will impact in the near term.
>>> Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with.
     On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to predict precisely as to where we land.
     But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.
     Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024.
     We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
     And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.
     Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
     Elon Musk

Not at this time.
