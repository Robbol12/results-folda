    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.</span>
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash

    Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
    Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
    That would also bring some savings from higher production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.</span>
    So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
    And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like
any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I
call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> pounds 
right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
    You’re still fat.
    So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
    That’s the actual way.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years.
    But <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span> months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t

    Texas is now our primary <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility.

    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the

    So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
    There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
    We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
    So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
    Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
    We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
    So, they will impact in the near term.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">will be dealing with.</span>
    On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to 
predict precisely as to where we land.
    But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a 
daily basis.

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional 
cost downs for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
