Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team for achieving <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will so far exceed the average --

    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">231</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners 
to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to reduce costs.
    Pierre Ferragu

Excellent.
    Thank you.
    And I…

Martin Viecha

Sorry, do you want to go say something?
    Andrew Baglino

I was going to say, we&#x27;re also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, Y fleet.
    And we&#x27;re gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we 
didn&#x27;t know we had out of the product.
    So over the course of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> on the powertrain side, we&#x27;re actually going to go after sort of some materials where 
we&#x27;re paying for more performance than we need, or we have more content than we need, without impacting reliability at 
all.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    So we&#x27;re not just sort of relying on supply.
    We&#x27;re also doing design actions to bring cost out.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn&#x27;t, 
that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
    So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
    I&#x27;m just guessing here.
    So, this is -- that would be my guess.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">74</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.</span>
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
    Second, on cost reduction, we&#x27;re holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead 
efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
