    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
    First, I&#x27;m wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen 
platform.
    You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and 
powertrain.
    Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
    And do you believe -- we know that there&#x27;s a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> 
volts architecture, really employing your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> batteries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don&#x27;t think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
    We&#x27;re obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
    When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
    You don&#x27;t just throw it on the line and just build it.
    So we&#x27;re going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
    Sure, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it&#x27;s something we hope the industry adopts 
as well.
    We&#x27;re also open to partnering.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">84</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    This was achieved despite <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.
    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Cybertruck ramp.</span>
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
    On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase.
    Our data suggests that around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% of our vehicle buyers in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> never owned a Tesla before.
    We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a
Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And also, we have new orders come in after the launch.
    The auto numbers keep growing.
    So we&#x27;re now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained 
situation.
    And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn&#x27;t feel right to us to sort of gouge people for 
early delivery.
    So -- but really, the demand is off the hook.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.25</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million, something </span>

    But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Definitely is.
    Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">363</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    Like I said, it&#x27;s a game of pennies.
    We&#x27;ve talked about it before as well.
    And the team is constantly going and checking, where can we reduce the cost further.
    And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you&#x27;ve seen over the past few years?
    Probably not, because remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising, so then we 
did see benefits coming from that.
    So those are more or less taken care of.
    But there is more which we&#x27;re still chasing.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">chain team, because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">take out further cost.</span>
    But yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reduction at the same
pace completely in the future, because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there are 
limitations.
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    The increased scale also sort of helps us there.
    As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing.
    We&#x27;re looking at every penny, like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned.
    Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">22</span>% year-over-year.
    And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for 
the environment, optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking 
companies, going with full truckloads and just doing that, sort of.
