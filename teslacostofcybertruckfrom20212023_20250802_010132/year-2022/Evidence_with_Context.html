    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team for achieving <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And to be clear, for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will so far exceed the average -- 
the safety of the average human.

    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">849</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span style="color: #808000; text-decoration-color: #808000">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">65</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how do you balance the need for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> Model Y?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">610</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
    Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.</span>
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">9</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.

    In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners 
to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to reduce costs.

Excellent.
    Thank you.
    And I…

Martin Viecha

Sorry, do you want to go say something?
    Andrew Baglino

I was going to say, we&#x27;re also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, Y fleet.
    And we&#x27;re gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we 
didn&#x27;t know we had out of the product.
    So over the course of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> on the powertrain side, we&#x27;re actually going to go after sort of some materials where 
we&#x27;re paying for more performance than we need, or we have more content than we need, without impacting reliability at 
all.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    So we&#x27;re not just sort of relying on supply.
    We&#x27;re also doing design actions to bring cost out.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn&#x27;t, 
that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs.
    So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin.
    I&#x27;m just guessing here.
    So, this is -- that would be my guess.

    Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
    But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
    So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done 
in the past where you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">120</span> different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and 
then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
    So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the 
master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact 
that there’s a casting.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right?
    Like we are not just evaluating the pack and insulation either, it’s the pack plus the body, the integration, do we 
have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount.
    And I think we’ve gone through one iteration.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re going to do another one with Cybertruck.</span>
    I mean, we’re taking the learnings and doing – the next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture.
    That’s certainly a target.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going?
    And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving have any significant impact on timelines or potential progress?
    Elon Musk

Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt.
    It’s irony.

    So, our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in use, get the economic model for 
that dialed in, and then evaluate the size of cash flows at that point and make decisions then as to what’s next.
    Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
    Pierre Ferragu

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>

Martin Viecha

All right.
    Let’s go to the next one.
    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; First is regarding the Cybertruck.</span>
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck
in terms of number of parts?
    The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
    Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
    I mean, Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">13</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue 
improved further.
    For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID 
impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment.
    Note that in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>%.
    Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors.
    First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls.
    Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell 
production factories.
    Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost 
premium to Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Partially offsetting these impacts, we&#x27;ve continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the progress we&#x27;ve made in prior years.</span>
    These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.
    The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and 
commercial storage.
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
    Second, on cost reduction, we&#x27;re holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead 
efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And actually we’ve got front windshield.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it 
stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down.
    There is a small amount of production that we’re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum 
primarily, but it’s less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>% of the total increases we’ve seen so far.
    So we’re optimistic here based upon what we’re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will 
start to come in over time.
    But I just want to set expectations that there’s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, 
maybe some as we go into next year.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’ll probably see some cost reduction in </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">.</span>
    I’ll be surprised if we did not.
    George Gianarikas

And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon.
    With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the 
combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?
    Elon Musk

It’s not clear to me what the overlap is.
    It’s not zero, but it’s -- I think we’re reaching.
    I’m not worried about it.
    I’m not an investor.

    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.</span>
    We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
