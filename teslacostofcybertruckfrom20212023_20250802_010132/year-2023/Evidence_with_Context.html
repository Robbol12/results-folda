    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you for taking the questions.
    First, I&#x27;m wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen 
platform.
    You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and 
powertrain.
    Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
    And do you believe -- we know that there&#x27;s a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> 
volts architecture, really employing your <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> batteries.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?</span>
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don&#x27;t think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
    We&#x27;re obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
    When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
    You don&#x27;t just throw it on the line and just build it.
    So we&#x27;re going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
    Sure, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">48</span> volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it&#x27;s something we hope the industry adopts 
as well.
    We&#x27;re also open to partnering.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2024</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1716</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-weight: bold">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    This was achieved despite <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation.
    Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period.
    I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.
    In terms of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> financials, we ended the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">96</span> billion of revenue and generated $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.4</span> billion of free 
cash flow to end the year with over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">29</span> billion of cash and investments on hand.
    Our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.9</span> billion from the 
release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.
    This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have 
recently gone through a similar change in their account.
    Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&amp;P <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span>.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Cybertruck ramp.</span>
    As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially.
    That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this 
equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few.
    While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.
    On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase.
    Our data suggests that around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% of our vehicle buyers in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> never owned a Tesla before.
    We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a
Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
    It&#x27;s simpler.
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span>% and <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> program as we steadily </span>

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">6</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training.
    That’s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster.
    So that’s it.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And it’s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    Thank you.
    Just as a follow-up, I recognize there’s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you’re sticking with your near 
term, your volume target of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% CAGR.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution.</span>
    There’s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth.
    But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking 
differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
    Elon Musk

It’s not about getting more share.
    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">71</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[PLAN]</span>
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.</span>
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.

Yes.

    So, in Texas, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?

    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.

    So, to date, over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.

    This is a question we get asked a lot.
    So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
    This is a onetime amnesty.
    So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within 
reasonable delivery time frames.
    So yes, I hope this makes people happy.

Right.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">pricing and specifications?</span>
    Elon Musk

Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.
    So, that’s really not an issue.
    I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.
    It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle.
    So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain 
and internal production.
    So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth.
    We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And also, we have new orders come in after the launch.
    The auto numbers keep growing.
    So we&#x27;re now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained 
situation.
    And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn&#x27;t feel right to us to sort of gouge people for 
early delivery.
    So -- but really, the demand is off the hook.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">0.25</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million, something </span>

Definitely is.

    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.

Yes, absolutely.
    So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
    Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
    That would also bring some savings from higher production.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.</span>
    So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
    And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like
any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I
call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> pounds 
right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
    You’re still fat.
    So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
    That’s the actual way.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
    As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the Cybertruck is no different.</span>
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.

    Like I said, it&#x27;s a game of pennies.
    We&#x27;ve talked about it before as well.
    And the team is constantly going and checking, where can we reduce the cost further.
    And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you&#x27;ve seen over the past few years?
    Probably not, because remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising, so then we 
did see benefits coming from that.
    So those are more or less taken care of.
    But there is more which we&#x27;re still chasing.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">chain team, because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">take out further cost.</span>
    But yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reduction at the same
pace completely in the future, because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there are 
limitations.
    Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
    The increased scale also sort of helps us there.
    As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing.
    We&#x27;re looking at every penny, like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned.
    Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">22</span>% year-over-year.
    And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for 
the environment, optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking 
companies, going with full truckloads and just doing that, sort of.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But first order approximation, there’s like <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck.
    And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>.
    So, it’s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, 
and we will be delivering the car this year.

    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cell production in Texas increased <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck cell with </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.</span>
    This quarter we convert to building a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> of the Texas <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.

Similar path for the next-gen platform?
    Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean Cybertruck is -- yes.
    I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck.
    Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while.</span>
    And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach
volume, to be prosperous.
    It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness.
    So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have 
mega <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span>-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> are quite in the same way
as the Cybertruck.
    I think it will be quite a fast ramp.
    As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per 
minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.

    So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
    There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
    We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
    So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
    Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
    We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
    So, they will impact in the near term.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">will be dealing with.</span>
    On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to 
predict precisely as to where we land.
    But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a 
daily basis.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional 
cost downs for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
    And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?

Not at this time.
