3. [Sentence #1281]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on **Cybertruck** in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.

8. [Sentence #1551]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for **Cybertruck**?
9. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for **Cybertruck** volume production besides battery shortage?
10. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in **Cybertruck** production.
11. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the **Cybertruck** that will take some time to work through.
12. [Sentence #1866]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And then, there's a question of like, what's the average **cost** of **Cybertruck** and to what degree is that affordable?
13. [Sentence #1869]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I worry more about like how do we the **Cybertruck** affordable despite having awesome technology.
14. [Sentence #2024]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I mean, it's going to be -- I think it's way cheaper to draw a price point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past three or four years will be capable of that, than a bus or a subway, will **cost** less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.
15. [Sentence #2034]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And I think you made reference to **Cybertruck** maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
16. [Sentence #2035]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and **Cybertruck** in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
