[TSLA_Q1_2022 [Transcript]] tell me about cybertruck production in 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #65] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.
     And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
     So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
>>> And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.

2. [Sentence #407] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in use, get the economic model for that dialed in, and then evaluate the size of cash flows at that point and make decisions then as to what’s next.
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
     Pierre Ferragu

[Technical Difficulty]

Martin Viecha

All right.
     Let’s go to the next one.
     The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Two questions I have.
>>> First is regarding the Cybertruck.
     And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts?
     The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
     Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.

3. [Sentence #261] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So there’s actually 10% and 15% of our stations in GA because of the general assembly [Technical Difficulty].
     So, really, like I think about this and the way we think about cars, if you’re waiting for the best Tesla, you’re going to be waiting forever.
     If you’re waiting for investment, you’re also going to be waiting forever because every new factory is better than the last one because we take all that learning and triple it…

Elon Musk

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Yes Next question is at Cyber Rodeo, Elon mentioned that a futuristic driverless robotaxi vehicle is on the roadmap.
     When can we expect more details on the product offering to be unveiled?
     Is this something that people can own, or will this be only offered by Tesla as a service?
     Elon Musk

So, I think we want to hold up on -- we don’t want to jump the gun on an exciting product announcement too much.
>>> So, I think, we’ll aim to -- we do a product event for robotaxi next year and get into more detail, but we are aiming for volume production in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     And maybe the last question from investors is, what is the current run rate of 4680 cell production at Fremont and at Giga Texas?
     What do you expect run rates of 4680 to be in Fremont and the Giga Texas or Berlin at the end of the year?
     Elon Musk

Well, Berlin is using the 2170 nonstructural pack.
     So, they’re not constrained by 4680.
     They will transition to 4680 hopefully later this year, but current billing production does not to require that.
     We also have, just as a risk mitigation, 2170 nonstructural pack capability in -- here at Giga Texas as well.

4. [Sentence #171] [UNCERTAIN]
     And then, Drew, do you want to continue to with it?
     Andrew Baglino

I was just going to say that 100 volts is also kind of like a spreadsheet exercise, right?
     Elon Musk

$100.
     Andrew Baglino

Sorry.
     $100.
     It’s roughly like a spreadsheet exercise, like you have to get through the full program to the end to see that maybe it’s been whittled away to $50 or less.
     On bigger vehicles, where you’re talking about higher power on the charging side or higher power from the battery to the power electronics or you need more torque, so the current requirements go up, there’s a little bit more semiconductor and actual conductor savings of going to the higher voltage.
>>> And so, we do consider that for Semi and Cybertruck.
     But for the 3/Y platform where we’ve got everything running and the benefit is questionably small.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It’s basically zero for robotaxi.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     For robotaxi, yes, it doesn’t make sense.
     Elon Musk

No, no.
     Sorry, this...

Andrew Baglino

Sounds good.

5. [Sentence #63] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.

     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
     We still have cells in [Technical Difficulty]

Elon Musk

Mention count.
     Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.

I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.
     Lars Moravy

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it takes all the long-term impact.
