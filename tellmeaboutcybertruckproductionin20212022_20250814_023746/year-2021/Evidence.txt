3. [Sentence #1160]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And then we will add [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
4. [Sentence #1281]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.

9. [Sentence #1551]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow]?
10. [Sentence #1555]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
11. [Sentence #1658]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow], Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] hopefully next year.
12. [Sentence #1863]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] volume [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow] besides battery shortage?
13. [Sentence #1864]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] [white on yellow]production[/white on yellow].
14. [Sentence #1865]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] that will take some time to work through.
15. [Sentence #1866]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] and to what degree is that affordable?

17. [Sentence #1871]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
18. [Sentence #2034]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And I think you made reference to [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
19. [Sentence #2035]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and [white on yellow]Cybertruck[/white on yellow] in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
