[Year 2021] tell me about cybertruck production in 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #1863, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.

2. [Sentence #1658, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
     So, that's a good result.
     But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
     So, if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
     And the same is true of this year.
     So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
     It would not make any sense because we'll still be part constrained.
>>> We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
     That is most likely.
     But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
     So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
     This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
     If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
     Capital equipment is distilled labor.
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
-----
3. [Sentence #1117, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
     I think Zach spoke to that well.
     And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
     We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.
     While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
>>> As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
     And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
     Lars Moravy

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
     This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
     In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
     If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.

4. [Sentence #1286, TSLA_Q3_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
     Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
>>> We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
     As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
     And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
     There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.
     We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.

     We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

5. [Sentence #76, TSLA_Q1_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
     And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
>>> In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.

     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Very good quarter.
     I had two quick questions.
     First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
     Who are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
>>> And the second question is related to Cybertruck.
     Who is the supply looking at?
     If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for Cybertruck?
     That's all for me.
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     Sure.
     So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
     With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.

9. [Sentence #1282, TSLA_Q3_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
     And so, this already does exist.
     And not directly in the form here.

     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

14. [Sentence #1160, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     We'll continue to ramp that factory.
     And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
     Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
     But we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.
     And so, we'll take Model Y at these factories.
     We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.
     And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.
>>> And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
     So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
     And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.
     We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.

Great.

     I just do not understand how profound change this is.
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
     You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
     That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
>>> And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
     If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
     If an asset has 5 times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.
     So, if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because still you don't want to drive.
     So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
     So, it's probably better than 5 times, I don't know.

     And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with our suppliers and vendors to make sure those timelines and supply meet the need and demand of our customers.
     Andrew Baglino

And on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some.
     They're largely associated with the different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaboration with like local codes and other governing requirements that drives the differences in the architecture between the locations.
