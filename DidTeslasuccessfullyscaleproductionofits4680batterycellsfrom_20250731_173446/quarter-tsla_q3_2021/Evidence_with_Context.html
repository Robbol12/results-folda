    Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these 
factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp.
    These factories will also partially lay on our margins as we work towards volume production.
    Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I&#x27;m excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and
into <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing 
to improve our precision and pace of execution.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on 
track to be complete this quarter.
    Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
    However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
    Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
    And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the 
pack timeline I just mentioned.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>
<span class="r5">the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5">?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span class="r2">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> model 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?

    I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive 
flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
    These teams&#x27; expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these 
challenges.
    Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we&#x27;re adding capacity as quickly as 
possible.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.
    The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our 
existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
    Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack 
production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.</span>
    And we&#x27;re excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
    Financially, our auto gross margins reached <span class="r2">30.5</span>% on a GAAP basis and just under <span class="r2">29</span>%, excluding regulatory credits, 
which was our strongest yet.
    This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the 
Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
    The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the 
ramp of Model X.
    As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
    However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
    Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our 
financials.
