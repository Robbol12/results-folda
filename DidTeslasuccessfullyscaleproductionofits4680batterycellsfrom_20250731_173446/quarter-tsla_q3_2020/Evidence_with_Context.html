    First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say what, rather than compare to other 
products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you -- what&#x27;s the limit of physics?
    What&#x27;s the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there?
    And that was our aspiration.
    And I think we&#x27;ve got a pretty good approach to it, which will have to get better over time.
    And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of battery design and production.
    And we&#x27;ll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology.
    The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures 
required are a-third or less of what they are today.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale.</span>
    Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release.
    The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team.
    I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team.
    And there&#x27;s a lot of really talented people in that team who&#x27;ve worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the 
beta release out.
    So I&#x27;d just really like to thank them for their hard work.
    And it&#x27;s just a very smart group of people.
    So I think we&#x27;re starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place.

    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>
<span class="r5">the same time as vehicle production?</span>
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span class="r2">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.

Operator

Thank you.
    <span class="r9">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r9">]</span> Our first question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
    Please go ahead.
    Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day, looked like you could be approaching something like </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5"> </span>
<span class="r5">million vehicles by </span><span class="r5">2030</span><span class="r5">, if you hit those goals.</span>
    Could you maybe share with us a little bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by <span class="r2">2025</span>, and maybe give
us a little bit more insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $<span class="r2">2</span> billion to $<span class="r2">2.5</span> 
billion per year into context?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through exponential is that if things are 
doubling every year or even just growing <span class="r2">50</span>%, then if you shift one -- plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the 
number.
    So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot, but it&#x27;s actually what&#x27;s going 
on is a giant S-curve.
    So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves, that integrate into a gigantic S-curve.
    So that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s difficult to predict the middle.
    And I&#x27;m not saying for sure we&#x27;ll hit <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicles.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">613</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So you&#x27;re seeing this trend happening across the globe.
    And it&#x27;s going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
    So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those <span class="r2">2</span> working together in tandem and the software 
layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware 
platform and software together.
    RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like 
we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
    So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we&#x27;re continuing to make money off of that power plant.
    Philippe Houchois

Okay.
    Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration </span>
<span class="r5">approach.</span>
    It&#x27;s very interesting.
    And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla 
Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?
    Or am I not thinking about it the right way?
    Elon Musk

It will be obsolete long term, yes.
    Good.
    I mean..

Philippe Houchois

Are you talking -- yes?
    Elon Musk

I mean several years from now.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">23</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    All right.
    So Q3 was our best quarter in history.
    We achieved the record production deliveries, record revenue, record net income; both GAAP and non-GAAP and record 
free cash flow of $<span class="r2">1.4</span> billion.
    This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team.
    I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people.
    Just really kickass performance across -- throughout the world.
    Of course, we had our Battery Day.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell </span>
<span class="r5">technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology </span>
<span class="r5">level.</span>
    There&#x27;s only a comment I made in the past is that, I think, Tesla&#x27;s long-term competitive strength will be primarily
manufacturing.
    This is counterintuitive, but I&#x27;m quite confident this will be what happens.
    All right.
    So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries.
    We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch.
    First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say what, rather than compare to other 
products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you -- what&#x27;s the limit of physics?
    What&#x27;s the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">124</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r2">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r2">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r2">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r2">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r2">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
    As were previous investments in Model <span class="r2">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r2">2</span> billion to $<span class="r2">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as</span>
<span class="r5">investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.</span>
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span class="r2">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span class="r2">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span class="r2">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r2">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r2">500</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
