[Year Q4] Did Tesla successfully scale production of its 4680 battery cells from the 2020 Battery Day announcement through 2021?

1. [Sentence #601, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
     This is a critical milestone for the Company.
     So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
     So, we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
     But that's not the most important thing.
     We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
     But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
>>> So, in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
     Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future.
     Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
     In 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
     So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
     And yes, so that's -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
     And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020.
     Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.

2. [Sentence #195, TSLA_Q4_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, it is a whole thing in and of itself.
     And this is something which we offer potentially as a service.
     So, some of the others need neural net training, we're not trying to keep it to ourselves.
     So, I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
     And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than average human to 2,000% better than average human.
     So, that will be very helpful in that regard.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is what is Tesla's current gigawatt-hour run rate of the 4680 cell production?
     How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?
     Elon Musk

I think we kind of talked about that true.
     I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022.
     It's not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
     But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Yes.
-----
3. [Sentence #315, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
     So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development?
     What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
     Elon Musk

All right.
     So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
     So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
     We've got the designs fixed.
     We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
-----
4. [Sentence #649, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
     Sure.
     So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
>>> As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022 or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans, based on the information we have.
     But we are making meaningful progress of the ramp curve in Kato.
     We're building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas.
     I was driving one yesterday and the day before.
     And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter.
     Our focus on the cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year.
     And the 4680 and pack tool installations here at Giga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing first parts.
     And the internet has also noticed that.
-----
5. [Sentence #398, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     And so, we’re able now to make investments there and also in the supercharging network to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term, but is what the right long-term thing is for our customers and the company.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.
     Please go ahead.
     Alex Potter

Great.
     Thanks.
     I was wondering, you mentioned how you'd like to increase your purchases of cells from suppliers.
>>> Does this require them to also have the capability to build structural 4680 cells of the sort that you're putting in these newer iterations of vehicles?
     Elon Musk

No, it does not.
     Although, we are talking with them about making the 4680 form factor, but they -- it is not required.
     For example, the new S currently uses the 18650 form factor.
     So they're just a more advanced cell, and we think we'll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years.
     But we will, over time, be retiring the form factors and try to move to a consistent form factor.
     But it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers, because they would -- it would just result in fewer cells.
     So it's better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factors than insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today.
-----
6. [Sentence #664, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     Yes, I was touring the factory -- the cell factory here.
     I’m super pumped.
     It’s like a really exciting accomplishment for us to bring everything into one Austin factory here in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     And just to repeat Drew's point, we are still -- we still expect to be part or primarily chip-limited this year.
     So, that's the thing that's actually the driver.
     And that chip limitation should alleviate next year.
>>> And then probably, we transition into a cell limitation battery, total gigawatt-hours of cell limitation, which is when the 4680 will become very important.
     Andrew Baglino

Agreed.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now, Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Elon Musk

Long opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a financially transformative year for the Company.
-----
7. [Sentence #302, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
>>> So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
-----
8. [Sentence #158, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coating of the battery electrode?
     At the Battery Day, Elon said, 'I would not say this is completely in the bag as – yet as the yields were low.'
     Elon Musk

Andrew?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     Sure.
     It's true.
>>> The in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains new processes and equipment.
     So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges to arise through the production ramp.
     The Kato team, however, has been able to solve each manufacturing problem presented to date, and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-week and month-over-month as we move up the production S-Curve.
     At the same time, the cell engineering teams refined designs, and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in the drive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.
     And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.
     The production staff is nearly all hired.
     Our material supply chain is established and the team is on track for full production ramp this year.
     Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineering confidence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick off manufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal.
-----
9. [Sentence #479, TSLA_Q4_2020] [NO EVIDENCE]
     I don't know it grew -- it's not like year one.
     So three, maybe four years, give ourselves a little room.
     But for three or four years, I’d say.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     We put together the trajectory in the Battery Day, and we're on that trajectory still.
     I think that's probably the best reference for the cost trajectory that we are on.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
>>> We're aspiring to do better than Battery Day, but we are confident of at least for doing what we presented at Battery Day.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird.
     Please go ahead.
     Ben Kallo

Hey, guys.
     Thank you, Elon, congrats to the whole team.
     So we're trying to put together all the breadcrumbs.
     If I remember correctly, going back 10 years, you talked about when you have a mass market car on the road, that you'd step down as CEO and be a Chief Architect.
-----
10. [Sentence #703, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And with the rapid development of FSD, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the profits generated by selling hardware.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team for a terrific 2021, and thank you to our suppliers who supported us.
     Looking forward to another great year.
     Elon Musk

I'd like to just second the thank you to suppliers.
     A lot of suppliers worked late nights, weekends, vacations around the world, and we're very grateful for that.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let's go to the Q&A from the investor side.
>>> The first question was on 4680 cells, which we already answered.
     So, let's go to the second question.
     How is the progress of the $25,000 compact car?
     Can you give an update?
     Elon Musk

Well, we're not currently working on a $25,000 car.
     At some point, we will, but we have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plate, frankly.
     So, at some point, there will be.
     I think that's sort of a question that -- it's sort of the wrong question.
-----
11. [Sentence #440, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     The thing to bear in mind is that there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output.
     It's like -- if one is not involved in manufacturing, it's really hard to appreciate just how hard this to scale production is.
     It's the hardest thing in the world.
     Prototypes are easy.
     Scaling production is very hard.
     So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, for example, Tesla Semi is that we simply don't happen our cells group.
     We -- this -- if we were to make the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but we would not have enough to cells built for it right now.
>>> We will have cells group in ourselves for Semi when we were producing the 4680 volume.
     But for example, Semi would use typically 5x the number of cells that car would use, but it would not sell for 5x what a car would sell for.
     So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.
     The same would go for that.
     Joseph Spak

Okay.
     Thank you.
     And then maybe if I could dig into your past on one more item.
     About 2 years ago, at the Autonomy Day, you stated that you're working on the next-gen Tesla chip which was about 2 years away.
-----
12. [Sentence #1039, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
     And so, that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
     To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.
     In the end, it's about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.
     And when you compare like an iron cell with a nickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens in certain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of that and design to that.
     So, it isn't like the ultimate form factor for all things.
     There's other form factors that could be better for an iron cell, for example.
>>> Elon Musk

So, we don't use 4680 at all for the iron cells.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Thanks.
     And I have a quick follow-up on chips.
     So, you've talked a lot about all this shortage and the supply difficulties.
     And I was wondering if you could give us some color on like the power chips you need for investors and all the power systems you're putting together versus like the more traditional logic chips, if the situation is different between the two?
     And should we understand from the situation today that you're working very hard also at expanding the scope of your suppliers?
     And should we expect like Tesla to take on board additional suppliers in the near term, especially on the power side?
-----
13. [Sentence #648, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?

     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
     So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter and at the same time that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
     And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally.
     But I'd be curious to hear you talk about how you think about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well.
     And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does 4680 become?
>>> Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
     Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business?
     And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners or suppliers on the form factor and they're all working on it.
     And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
     And so, that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
     To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.

     The next question is what is Tesla's current gigawatt-hour run rate of the 4680 cell production?
     How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Yes.
     Agreed, Elon.
     And as you've said before, with the S curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next.
     So, yes, I mean we are progressing up that S curve as fast as we possibly can.
-----
16. [Sentence #290, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     I think some of it works well in China, then we will have a Grade 4 FSD.
     I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
     Their attention to detail is incredible.
     So they -- I'm confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
     And we hopefully that is later this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
>>> Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
     What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.

     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
     So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
     And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.

     The in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains new processes and equipment.
     So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges to arise through the production ramp.
     The Kato team, however, has been able to solve each manufacturing problem presented to date, and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-week and month-over-month as we move up the production S-Curve.
     At the same time, the cell engineering teams refined designs, and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in the drive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.
     And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.
     The production staff is nearly all hired.
     Our material supply chain is established and the team is on track for full production ramp this year.
>>> Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineering confidence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick off manufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, why are you confident Tesla will achieve Level 5 autonomy in 2021?
     And why is Dojo not necessary to get there?
     Elon Musk

I guess, I'm confident based on my understanding of the technical roadmap and the progress that we're making between each beta iteration.
     Yes.
     As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car to completely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections.

     And we hopefully that is later this year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
     Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
>>> What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.

23. [Sentence #840, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
     Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
>>> Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.

     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
     So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
>>> In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
