[TSLA_Q4_2021] Did Tesla successfully scale production of its 4680 battery cells from the 2020 Battery Day announcement through 2021?

1. [Sentence #24] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
     This is a critical milestone for the Company.
     So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
     So, we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
     But that's not the most important thing.
     We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
     But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
>>> So, in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
     Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future.
     Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
     In 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
     So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
     And yes, so that's -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
     And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020.
     Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.

2. [Sentence #72] [PLAN]
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
     Sure.
     So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
>>> As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022 or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans, based on the information we have.
     But we are making meaningful progress of the ramp curve in Kato.
     We're building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas.
     I was driving one yesterday and the day before.
     And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter.
     Our focus on the cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year.
     And the 4680 and pack tool installations here at Giga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing first parts.
     And the internet has also noticed that.
-----
3. [Sentence #87] [PLAN]
     Yes, I was touring the factory -- the cell factory here.
     I’m super pumped.
     It’s like a really exciting accomplishment for us to bring everything into one Austin factory here in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     And just to repeat Drew's point, we are still -- we still expect to be part or primarily chip-limited this year.
     So, that's the thing that's actually the driver.
     And that chip limitation should alleviate next year.
>>> And then probably, we transition into a cell limitation battery, total gigawatt-hours of cell limitation, which is when the 4680 will become very important.
     Andrew Baglino

Agreed.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now, Zach has some opening remarks as well.
     Elon Musk

Long opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a financially transformative year for the Company.

4. [Sentence #126] [PLAN]
     And with the rapid development of FSD, software-based profits will ultimately become a strong addition to the profits generated by selling hardware.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team for a terrific 2021, and thank you to our suppliers who supported us.
     Looking forward to another great year.
     Elon Musk

I'd like to just second the thank you to suppliers.
     A lot of suppliers worked late nights, weekends, vacations around the world, and we're very grateful for that.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let's go to the Q&A from the investor side.
>>> The first question was on 4680 cells, which we already answered.
     So, let's go to the second question.
     How is the progress of the $25,000 compact car?
     Can you give an update?
     Elon Musk

Well, we're not currently working on a $25,000 car.
     At some point, we will, but we have enough on our plate right now, too much on our plate, frankly.
     So, at some point, there will be.
     I think that's sort of a question that -- it's sort of the wrong question.
-----
5. [Sentence #462] [PLAN]
     And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
     And so, that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
     To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.
     In the end, it's about cost competitiveness, scalability of manufacturing.
     And when you compare like an iron cell with a nickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens in certain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of that and design to that.
     So, it isn't like the ultimate form factor for all things.
     There's other form factors that could be better for an iron cell, for example.
>>> Elon Musk

So, we don't use 4680 at all for the iron cells.
     Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
     Thanks.
     And I have a quick follow-up on chips.
     So, you've talked a lot about all this shortage and the supply difficulties.
     And I was wondering if you could give us some color on like the power chips you need for investors and all the power systems you're putting together versus like the more traditional logic chips, if the situation is different between the two?
     And should we understand from the situation today that you're working very hard also at expanding the scope of your suppliers?
     And should we expect like Tesla to take on board additional suppliers in the near term, especially on the power side?
-----
6. [Sentence #71] [PLAN]
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
     Sure.
>>> So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680 effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
     As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022 or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans, based on the information we have.
     But we are making meaningful progress of the ramp curve in Kato.
     We're building 4680 structural packs every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas.
     I was driving one yesterday and the day before.
     And we believe our first 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter.
     Our focus on the cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year.

7. [Sentence #450] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
     So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter and at the same time that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
     And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally.
     But I'd be curious to hear you talk about how you think about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well.
     And how you see in the long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does 4680 become?
>>> Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
     Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in all cars, whatever the chemistry also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business?
     And do you expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners or suppliers on the form factor and they're all working on it.
     And they look at it the way we look at it as a way to drive fundamental cost efficiencies in production and also ultimately, the design of the cell itself to drive the cost down of the cell.
     And so, that's what's engaged -- I mean, we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor there, engaged because they think it's a good form factor, and we want people to make it for sure.
     To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be.

8. [Sentence #273] [PLAN]
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
     So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
     And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.
-----
9. [Sentence #263] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
     Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
>>> Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
