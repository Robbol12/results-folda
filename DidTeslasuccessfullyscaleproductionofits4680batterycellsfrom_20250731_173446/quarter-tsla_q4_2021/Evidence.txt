[TSLA_Q4_2021] Did Tesla successfully scale production of its 4680 battery cells from the 2020 Battery Day announcement through 2021?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #24]  So, in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural **battery** pack and the **4680** **cells**, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
2. [Sentence #71]  So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house **4680** effort to provide us flexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible.
3. [Sentence #72]  As we sit today, sales from suppliers is actually -- it sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that you mentioned, Elon, in 2022 or to say differently, **4680** **cells** are not a constraint to our 2022 volume plans, based on the information we have.
4. [Sentence #87]  And then probably, we transition into a cell limitation **battery**, total gigawatt-hours of cell limitation, which is when the **4680** will become very important.
5. [Sentence #126]  The first question was on **4680** **cells**, which we already answered.
6. [Sentence #263]  Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck **production**.
7. [Sentence #273]  The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of **scale**; number two, **production** design -- **production** line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
8. [Sentence #450]  Is it going to be outside of Tesla the largest form factor for batteries?
9. [Sentence #462]  Elon Musk

So, we don't use **4680** at all for the iron **cells**.
