[Year Q3] Did Tesla successfully scale production of its 4680 battery cells from the 2020 Battery Day announcement through 2021?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core **battery** technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology level.
2. [Sentence #33]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of **battery** design and **production**.
3. [Sentence #36]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) And we expect Giga Berlin will see our first **battery** cell **production** line at **scale**.
4. [Sentence #124]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including **battery** cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
5. [Sentence #162]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start **4680** cell **production** at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle **production**?
6. [Sentence #163]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Can Tesla share more information on what products you'll use the **battery** **cells** from the pilot line in Fremont?
7. [Sentence #326]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Just wanted to ask about the targets from your **Battery** **Day**, looked like you could be approaching something like 20 million vehicles by 2030, if you hit those goals.
8. [Sentence #613]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) And the follow-up question I had was, during the **Battery** **Day**, you talked about this cell vehicle integration approach.
9. [Sentence #676]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house **battery** manufacturing program.
10. [Sentence #702]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with **4680** **cells**?
11. [Sentence #704]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural **battery** crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.
12. [Sentence #738]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle **production** capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
