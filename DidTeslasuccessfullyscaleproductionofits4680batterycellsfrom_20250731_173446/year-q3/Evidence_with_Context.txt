[Year Q3] Did Tesla successfully scale production of its 4680 battery cells from the 2020 Battery Day announcement through 2021?

1. [Sentence #36, TSLA_Q3_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say what, rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics?
     What's the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there?
     And that was our aspiration.
     And I think we've got a pretty good approach to it, which will have to get better over time.
     And we went through all of the engineering solutions for every important part of battery design and production.
     And we'll continue to iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology.
     The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capital expenditures required are a-third or less of what they are today.
>>> And we expect Giga Berlin will see our first battery cell production line at scale.
     Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release.
     The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team.
     I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team.
     And there's a lot of really talented people in that team who've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out.
     So I'd just really like to thank them for their hard work.
     And it's just a very smart group of people.
     So I think we're starting very slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place.

     We're pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation.
     Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
     Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
     In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
     I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
     And let's begin with questions from say.com.
>>> The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the same time as vehicle production?
     Can Tesla share more information on what products you'll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Drew, do you want to take that?
     Drew Baglino

Sure.
     Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
     And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you.
     [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
     Please go ahead.
     Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.
>>> Just wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day, looked like you could be approaching something like 20 million vehicles by 2030, if you hit those goals.
     Could you maybe share with us a little bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025, and maybe give us a little bit more insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year into context?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through exponential is that if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift one -- plus/minus one year, it has a huge effect on the number.
     So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massively exceeded or massively undershot, but it's actually what's going on is a giant S-curve.
     So a whole bunch of pretty big S-curves, that integrate into a gigantic S-curve.
     So that's why it's difficult to predict the middle.
     And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles.
-----
5. [Sentence #702, TSLA_Q3_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Please keep in mind that we are pushing the boundaries on new product and manufacturing technologies at these factories, which makes it difficult to predict the exact pace of the ramp.
     These factories will also partially lay on our margins as we work towards volume production.
     Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022.
     The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
>>> The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with 4680 cells?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
     Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.
     Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
     However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
     Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
     And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

6. [Sentence #613, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe.
     And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level.
     So Megapack on one end and then PowerWall on the other side, those 2 working together in tandem and the software layer on top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient using the hardware platform and software together.
     RJ Johnson

And just a point of clarification, like that the large power plant in -- largest battery power plant in Australia, like we continue to operate that power plant and generate revenue in the market.
     So whether we could have sold it from or less, like we're continuing to make money off of that power plant.
     Philippe Houchois

Okay.
     Thank you.
>>> And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cell vehicle integration approach.
     It's very interesting.
     And when I look at that -- when I think about it, it looks like this means that the skateboard designed the Tesla Pioneer that many of your followers are using is going to become obsolete?
     Or am I not thinking about it the right way?
     Elon Musk

It will be obsolete long term, yes.
     Good.
     I mean..

Philippe Houchois

Are you talking -- yes?
     Elon Musk

I mean several years from now.
-----
7. [Sentence #23, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     All right.
     So Q3 was our best quarter in history.
     We achieved the record production deliveries, record revenue, record net income; both GAAP and non-GAAP and record free cash flow of $1.4 billion.
     This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team.
     I could not be more proud to work with such a great group of people.
     Just really kickass performance across -- throughout the world.
     Of course, we had our Battery Day.
>>> So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in the future and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistry level and I think more significantly at the manufacturing technology level.
     There's only a comment I made in the past is that, I think, Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarily manufacturing.
     This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.
     All right.
     So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries.
     We wanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch.
     First, wishful thinking, just look at it from the fundamental physics and say what, rather than compare to other products in the market, just say from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics?
     What's the platonic idea of the perfect cell and how close can we get there?

8. [Sentence #124, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
>>> This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
     While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.

     Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
     As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
     As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
     Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
     As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
     Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
>>> The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.
     And so, you can extrapolate that out.
     There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.
     There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.
     But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

10. [Sentence #704, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I'm excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and into 2022.
     The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing to improve our precision and pace of execution.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
     The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with 4680 cells?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
>>> Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.

     And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
-----
11. [Sentence #676, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
     These teams' expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these challenges.
     Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.
     The only practical way to address this in the immediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines, which is where we are focused.
     Similar dynamics are also playing out in our storage business as we are working to expand Powerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts themselves allow us to do so.
>>> Additionally, we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program.
     And we're excited to have expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.
     Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29%, excluding regulatory credits, which was our strongest yet.
     This benefit primarily comes from higher volumes, particularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have made good progress increasing Model S volumes.
     The Model S has now returned to positive gross margin and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.
     As was the case in Q2, there were some net benefit from pricing actions.
     However, this remains small in the context of other contributors.
     Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take time for the impact of recent changes to flow through our financials.
-----
12. [Sentence #33, TSLA_Q3_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     All right.
     So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries.

     I spent a lot of time with the Autopilot team.
     And there's a lot of really talented people in that team who've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out.
