    No, this is not certain.
    No new materials are necessary.
    We just need to scale this thing up.
    We -- the technology exists today to solve renewable energy.
    And some people say, well, why don’t we do it?
    That’s because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanely gigantic.
    So you can’t just go and do a zillion terawatts overnight.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; You have got to build the production capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for solar cells.</span>
    You have got to put that into vehicles.
    You have got to put that into stationary storage packs.
    You have got to put that it into solar panels and Solar Glass Roofs and you have got to deploy all of this stuff.
    But it’s certainly the case that we can accelerate this and we should try to accelerate it.
    And the right thing to do I think from an economic standpoint and I think almost any economist would agree is to 
have a carbon tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to be bad than good 
and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less.
    But the same should be true.
    We should tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy that we think is probably good.

Hi, guys.
    Thanks so much for taking my question.
    I’d love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day.
    In the last six, seven months, I was wondering how much progress you have made on that front, first in terms of 
process development.
    So how are things coming together on your pilot line?
    Are you getting to the kind of production throughput you are aiming for?
    And second, actually on your production ramp.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I was wondering in which size you are ramping production capacity for the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cell and where you stand on </span>
<span class="r5">ramping up that capacity as well?</span>
    And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that’s possible.
    Elon Musk

Well, so we have the – and Drew can add to this.
    But we have the - a small sort of pilot plant, which is still big by normal standards.
    We expect to have like a <span class="r2">10</span>-gigawatt-hour per year capability in Fremont, California.
    And we made quite a few cells.
    We are not quite yet at the point where we think the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we are 
getting close to that point.
    And then we have already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much of it for 
Austin as well.

    Through further investigation of the vehicle and the accident remains, we instructed the car with NTSB and we saw in
the local police and were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed, so it was leading to a likelihood 
that someone was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash and all seat belts post-crash were found to be unbuckled.
    We were unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time of impact, but the local authorities are working on 
doing that and we await their report.
    As I said, we continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future through this 
kind of data and other information from the field.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors.
    The first question is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claim that lithium ion is unsuited to 
long-term storage at scale due to vampire drain.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Could </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells address this limitation?</span>
    Is the limitation even relevant for changing the energy equation?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Just let me jump in on the vampire drain.
    That’s definitely not the issue.
    Good lithium ion cell self-discharges less than <span class="r2">0.001</span>% of its energy per day, so the vampire drain is maybe not…

Elon Musk

Myth.
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Elon Musk

As mythical as vampires.

    So we really don’t flick the nitty-gritty elements.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But overall, I think, we still feel quite optimistic about achieving volume production of the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> next year.</span>
    What do you think?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I think…

Pierre Ferragu

Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I think, Pierre, just one thing I’d add is, there’s been a lot of questions about yield.
    Actually, I noticed people asking about that.
    The yield progress isn’t really strong every day and we were really still in commissioning phases.

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">104</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as 
some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
    On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the
used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb 
fixed overheads.
    On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.
    This was driven by Solar Roof-related ramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease BPA business.
    We continue to manage through a multi-quarter backlog on Powerwall.
    We are working as fast as we can to increase production and this will aid in profitability of this business as those
volumes increase.
    On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which was driven by our investments in technology and growth.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular for R&amp;D, this includes the structural battery pack and </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells, investments in the new SNX, and our</span>
<span class="r5">neural net and silicon investments.</span>
    On the SG&amp;A side, we are setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA in anticipation of volume to 
come there.
    And as I have said before, our plans show that we remain on track for sustained industry-leading operating margins.
    Double clicking on cash flows, we continue to generate positive free cash flows and this was despite the significant
working capital headwinds from SNX.
    Additionally, we are making progress reducing various forms of debt.
    We also invested $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion in Bitcoin during the quarter, then trimmed our position by <span class="r2">10</span>%, which contributed to 
a small gain in our Q1 financials.
    Taking a step back, we have generated $<span class="r2">8</span> billion in operating cash flows and $<span class="r2">4</span> billion in free cash flows over the 
past four quarters.
    As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-term growth of <span class="r2">50</span>% annually and we believe we are on track 
to exceed that this year as we guided to last quarter.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">476</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And I was hoping, Zach, maybe you could just talk a little bit about OpEx.
    It was a noticeable increase, even excluding SBC, obviously, a lot going on this quarter.
    But can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that going forward?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On the R&amp;D side, you know what we are seeing, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is kind of a convergence of a 
series of programs that are happening and our R&amp;D OpEx spend kind of correlates to where we are in the product lifecycle
in different programs.
    And so we are kind of at the tail end of investments in what we call internally Paladium, which is the new Model S 
and Model X.
    And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are also getting very heavy into </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural</span>
<span class="r5">battery pack that goes along with that.</span>
    And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry.
    And so we are investing heavily there on an R&amp;D side to work out those kinks.
    And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of 
those.
    Then I also mentioned, and Elon talked a bit about, Dojo and the potential there.
    So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make 
investments in.
    On the SG&amp;A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global and China is ramping quite quickly.
    And we are trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume, so that we have the right sales capacity, 
store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the 
execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we have seen in the past and so we are 
making investments there ahead of the growth.

    So let’s move to analyst Q&amp;A.
    Operator

Thank you.
    First question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
    Your line is open.
    Pierre Ferragu

    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
    First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the 
first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
    Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not 
yet begun customer deliveries.
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span class="r2">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did </span>
<span class="r5">experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor </span>
<span class="r5">interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.</span>
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
    If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
    This is in spite of the costs mentioned for SNX and expedites and a reduction in global ASPs as our cost structure 
as a company is reducing at an even faster pace.
    So as we look out over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly as 
some of these headwinds we are experiencing start to be resolved.
    On Services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards profitability, aided by strength in the
used car business, operational improvements in service and additional service revenue opportunities that help absorb 
fixed overheads.
    On energy gross margins, these remained negative for a second quarter.

    I think, Pierre, just one thing I’d add is, there’s been a lot of questions about yield.
    Actually, I noticed people asking about that.
    The yield progress isn’t really strong every day and we were really still in commissioning phases.
    We were really still in commissioning phases with most of the tools to the point where we were confident that the 
yield trajectory aligns with our internal cost projections.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We did talk about yield also at Battery Day, which is one of the reasons why it’s useful to check in on that.</span>
    It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned, to go from prototype to production and it’s not just parts, it’s 
processes, it’s equipment.
    But as we have matured the process equipment, we have gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And basically, this is just a guess because we don’t know for sure, but it appears as though we are about <span class="r2">12</span>, 
probably, not more than <span class="r2">18</span> months away from volume production of the <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our cell supply partners ramp up their supply as much as 
possible.
    So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers.
    It is in conjunction with suppliers.

    Elon Musk

There’s no question in my mind whatsoever that the energy storage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, 
zero.
    I want to be clear, zero.
    I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based, lithium-ion cells.
    I will say, lithium-ion, people think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells.
    It’s more like <span class="r2">1</span>% to <span class="r2">2</span>% of the cell is lithium.
    The main part of the cell is the cathode.
    The main mass and cost in the cell is the cathode.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; For high energy cells, like, for example, what we use in most Teslas, have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which </span>
<span class="r5">have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.</span>
    However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it’s just staying on the ground and so I
think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, 
technically.
    But the phosphate part is unnecessary.
    It’s really just the iron or nickel.
    I am assuming the terminology.
    Just think of it as iron and nickel and there’s an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could have 
possibly used and there’s also more lithium than we could possibly use.
    Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium-ion cells.
