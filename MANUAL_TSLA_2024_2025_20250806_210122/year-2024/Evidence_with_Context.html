    This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in 
deployments year over year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.</span>
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
    For <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take

    Travis Axelrod

All right, thank you.
    The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
    Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
    Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
    Thanks for taking the questions.
    First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.
    You&#x27;ve leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">tariffs in Europe.</span>
    Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff 
side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being 
imported from China into Europe.
    While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second 
round.
    They visited our factory.
    They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Cybertruck and Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">goods.</span>
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

    We&#x27;re not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our 
options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we&#x27;ll move on to the next 
one.
    What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
    Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
    I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.</span>
    So it doesn&#x27;t make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
    So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.
    However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.
    And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the high volume version of Optimus 
will also be produced here in Texas.
