    This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
    While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% growth in 
deployments year over year in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
    This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
    The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on 
total cost of ownership.
    Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the 
business.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.</span>
    Over the years, we&#x27;ve tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts 
from across the world for all our businesses.
    Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
    Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
    The biggest driver of the increase was R&amp;D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
    The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
    For <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
    It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">600</span> million mark-to-market benefit from 
Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take 
mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.

able to generate free cash flow of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3.6</span> billion for the year.
    Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.
