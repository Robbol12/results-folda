[Multi-Year Analysis] tariffs

1. [Sentence #1931, TSLA_Q4_2024] [PLAN]
     This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall.
     Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up production with Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.
     While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least 50% growth in deployments year over year in 2025.
     Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year over year but declined sequentially.
     This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business.
     The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through the impact on total cost of ownership.
     Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business.
>>> There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs.
     Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses.
     Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, will have an impact on our business and profitability.
     Our operating expenses grew both year over year and sequentially.
     The biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives.
     The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program.
     For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives.
     It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward.

     Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite capex increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year.
     Capex efficiency is something we are extremely focused on.

3. [Sentence #2491, TSLA_Q1_2025] [PLAN]
     These expenses flow through R&D.
     We believe, even in the current environment, it is the right strategy making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.
     These increases were offset by decreases and the CNA from changes in our molecular flow program.
     (23:41)
Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis.
     The primary reason was … well, Bitcoin mark-to-market loss in Q1 versus gain in Q4 resulting in a 472 million drop.
     The remainder of the change is because of FX [inaudible 00:24:00].
     With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in our other income in addition to the FX [inaudible 00:24:10].
>>> I know tariffs is the hottest topic, which people talk about, and it has various impacts to our business.
     As Elon mentioned, on the wake business, we've been on this journey of regionalization for years.
     Specifically in the US, Model Y has been rated the most American made car on cars.com made in America index three years in a row.
     This, in part, is of all the work which team has been doing over the years, and to the extent that today, if you look at our vehicle lineup in US, where about approximately, on a weighted average basis, 85% USMCA compliant.
     (24:57)
So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the tariffs, but we're not immune, because when the Section 232 auto tariffs become effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization [inaudible 00:25:19], they will have an impact on profitability.
     And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand give or [inaudible 00:25:27], which is pretty much in line with what we've been forecasting.
     The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China.
     We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US, however, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity [inaudible 00:25:56].

4. [Sentence #3243, TSLA_Q2_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     We published a vehicle safety report earlier today.
     You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD.
     We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend.
     Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really increase.
     On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved 14%.
     This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
     This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
>>> We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L.
     Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive and less in energy.
     However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
     So costs will increase in the near term.
     While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
     The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
     We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
     Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
-----
5. [Sentence #2399, TSLA_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects.
     I mean, it remains to be seen.
     Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
     But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
     So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.
     (09:50)
And undoubtedly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
     I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision.
>>> I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.
     So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do.
     (10:38)
Now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla.
     So, first of all, autonomy.
     The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June.
     Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin.
     And then … Actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what's the Cybercab because we've got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi.
     It's very confusing.
-----
6. [Sentence #3038, TSLA_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     Yeah, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs to give people time to adjust, otherwise, I quote, you said, "The system would break and bad things would happen."
     So are things breaking yet?
     And if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?
     Elon Musk (01:21:33):

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I'm one of many advisors to the president, I'm not the president.
     But I've made my opinion clear to the president, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.
     He talks to many people and he makes his decision.
     And I'm hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of others, and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future, which we'll see.
>>> But I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally I'm an advocate for pre-trade and lower tariffs.
     Now one does need to take a look at if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or if a government is providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that.
     But I think that that's on a case by case basis, strategically.
     But the president is the elected representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would like to do.
     Adam Jonas (01:23:09):

Okay, Elon, I respect that.
     Just as a follow-up, and thanks again, between China and the United States, who in your opinion is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids?
     And also drones, I'd be interested.
     And is it even close?

With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains.
     This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
     So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects.

We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non- China-based suppliers, but it will take time.
     Also note that [inaudible 00:26:07] irrespective of all the impact on US from tariffs on the energy business, we do have mega-factory China, which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US.
>>> There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.
     I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to [inaudible 00:26:35] manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
     And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

Elon Musk (26:48):

The expense is bringing it in from China right now.
     Vaibhav Taneja (26:49):

Exactly.
     And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this [inaudible 00:27:01].
     Our CapEx [inaudible 00:27:05], inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of 10 billion this year.
     We are still evaluating what more to do on this one.
     To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and brand image.

     The next question is regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line.
     Could you confirm if it is currently operational?
     If so, what is the current production rate of Optimus bots per week?
>>> Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production line moving forward?
     Elon Musk (01:00:40):

I just want to emphasize, Optimus is still very much a development program.
     It's not a large volume production.
     That's why this year we will make a few.
     We do expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going be at the end of the year.
     Almost everything in Optimus is new.
     There's not an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really almost anything in the Optimus, apart from the Tesla AI computer, which is the same as one in the car.
     (01:01:26)
When you have a new complex manufactured product, it'll move as fast as the slowest and least lucky component in the entire thing.

14. [Sentence #2724, TSLA_Q1_2025] [NO EVIDENCE]
     Trying to get much below 30 seconds is extremely difficult, but if not… And you start getting into impossible… Where you have to be faster than a human could possibly move.
     Then the autonomous line, it really just needs to be robots moving really fast and that's where it gets us up five seconds.
     But we'll start off with getting a C… Instead of an A getting a C in a new architecture, but then the potential is there over time to move that up to an A+ within an A+ architecture.
     Travis Axelrod (50:49):

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks in the form of tariffs, political biases, et cetera.
     Speaker 3 (50:59):

As Elon said, we've been a supply chain team for a while.
>>> We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts, supplying near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai.
     For example, in North America, our high volume vehicle programs have over 85% North American content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local content on similar levels of regionalization as North America when you exclude the battery.
     And we are working on regionalizing the battery as well.
     (51:34)
This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, tool sourcing, vertical integration, advanced analytics and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production stability.
     Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tariffs are higher on our low volume platforms than the high volume ones.
     Elon Musk (51:58):

Yeah.
     In fact, there's no more vertically integrated car company than Tesla.
     We're the most vertically integrated car company since Henry Ford back in the day, when they were mining iron and stuff and growing rubber trees.

Hi.
     Thank you very much for the question.
     So I wanted to ask about the optimist supply chain, going forward.
     You mentioned very fast ramp up.
     What do you envision that supply chain looking like?
>>> Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the US now because of the tariffs?
     How does one think about what needs to happen there?
     Elon Musk (01:11:12):

We have to see how things settle out.
     I don't know yet.
     Some things we're doing as we already talked about, which is that we've already taken tremendous steps to localize our supply chain.
     We're more localized than any other manufacturer, and we have a lot of things underway to increase the localization, to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty.
     Did you have followup, Edison?
     Edison (01:11:50):

Yeah.

     While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
     The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
     We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
     Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
     Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
     The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
     The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
>>> This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.
     The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
     The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our best to try and manage through this.
     But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
     The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.
     Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute.
     Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow.
     We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.

We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non- China-based suppliers, but it will take time.
     Also note that [inaudible 00:26:07] irrespective of all the impact on US from tariffs on the energy business, we do have mega-factory China, which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US.
     There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.
     I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to [inaudible 00:26:35] manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
     And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

Elon Musk (26:48):

The expense is bringing it in from China right now.
     Vaibhav Taneja (26:49):

Exactly.
     And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this [inaudible 00:27:01].
>>> Our CapEx [inaudible 00:27:05], inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of 10 billion this year.
     We are still evaluating what more to do on this one.
     To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and brand image.
     We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner, and this is the reason we're still focused on bringing cheaper models to market soon, which start of production still planned for June.
     Additionally, the advancement in FSD related features, including pilot Robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, should help create a new area of demand.
     I would like to thank everyone at Tesla and our customers.
     Travis Axelrod (27:54):

Fantastic, thank you very much [inaudible 00:27:56].

All right, thank you.
     The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
     Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
     Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
     Thanks for taking the questions.
     First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.
     You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.
>>> But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of tariffs in Europe.
     Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe.
     While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round.
     They visited our factory.
     They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.
-----
20. [Sentence #719, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
     As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
     We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge.
     We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
     Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
     Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
     While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
>>> Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
     While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term.
     We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results.
     Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
     Energy storage backlog is strong.
     As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline.
     Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities.
     Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

21. [Sentence #795, TSLA_Q2_2024] [PLAN]
     We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
     Travis Axelrod

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one.
     What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
     Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
     I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.
>>> Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.
     So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
     So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.
     However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.
     And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
     Travis Axelrod

All right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.

     Vaibhav Taneja noted that federal budget legislation has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
     TAKEAWAYS
Robotaxi Launch and Expansion: Tesla (TSLA 4.30%) launched its first commercial robotaxi service in Austin with paying customers and the company has a goal of expanding the service to cover half the U.S. population by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.
     Robotaxi Miles and Safety Metrics: Ashok Elluswamy disclosed Robotaxis in Austin have exceeded 7,000 miles with no notable safety-critical interventions as of Q2 2025.
     Autonomous Ride-Hailing Rollout: Expansion to markets including the San Francisco Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida is pending regulatory approval as of Q2 2025, with service areas in Austin planned to expand more than tenfold.
     FSD Adoption Acceleration: Since the move to FSD version 12 in North America, FSD subscription rates have increased by 45%, and overall penetration has increased by 25% since the release of FSD 12 and B-38 in North America.
     Model Y Performance: Model Y became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria in June; it remains, per Musk, "the best-selling car of any kind in the world."
     Automotive Revenue Growth: Automotive revenue rose 19% sequentially on a 14% increase in deliveries, primarily due to improved average selling prices (“ASPs”) from new Model Y sales and a favorable mix, despite a reduction in regulatory credit revenue.
>>> Tariffs Impact: Tariff costs increased by approximately $300 million sequentially, with two-thirds impacting the automotive segment and further increases anticipated in subsequent quarters due to manufacturing and sales cycle latency.
     Automotive Product Portfolio: Production of lower-cost models began as planned in the first half; The ramp will occur in Q3 2025 and proceed more slowly than initially expected due to the focus on maximizing deliveries before the EV credit expires.
     Energy Business Performance: The company achieved record power deployment in Q2 2025, with sequential improvement in energy and solar margins, and attained the highest gross profit for the segment to date.
     Energy Business Tariff and Legislative Headwinds: Despite headwinds from tariffs and early expiration of consumer credits, customers -- especially in industrial storage -- have been willing to absorb some tariff impacts.
     Operating Expenses: Operating expenses grew sequentially on higher R&D investment in AI, greater stock-based compensation, and depreciation from AI compute infrastructure, with expectations for continued growth in these areas.
     Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was $146 million, as increased operating cash flows were offset by higher capital expenditures.
     CapEx Outlook: Management expects capital expenditures to exceed $9 billion for 2025.
     Regulatory Credit Revenue Decline: A legislative change eliminating emission penalties is expected to reduce new regulatory credit revenue quickly, per DevOps Ninja.
-----
23. [Sentence #3267, TSLA_Q2_2025] [PLAN]
     Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow.
     We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.
     Other income grew sequentially primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Redcom Holdings, which was a $284 million gain in Q2, while we got a $125 million loss in Q1.
     Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price.
     While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free cash flow.
     We continue to make investments in various aspects of that fashion, like Cybertruck, semi lines, and other infrastructure spend and the expansion of our AI initiatives.
     Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion.
>>> To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs.
     However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics, and our lead in energy set us up for a bright future.
     I would like to thank the whole Tesla, Inc. team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for their continued belief in us.
     Travis Axelrod: Great.
     Thanks very much, DevOps Ninja.
     So now we're going to move on to Say.com questions.
     The first question is, can you give us some insight into how robotaxis have been performing so far?
     And what rate do you expect to expand in terms of vehicles, geofence, cities, and supervisors?

     Optimus Production Timeline: Elon Musk projected prototypes of the Optimus three humanoid robot within three months and planned start of production early next year, with a medium-confidence target of ramping to about 100,000 units per month within five years.
     Dojo and AI Infrastructure: Musk said Dojo two will be operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around a hundred k h one hundred equivalent, and a new AI factory will hopefully be in production around the end of next year.
     Supercharging and Service Profitability: Supercharging, insurance, and service centers all contributed to sequential margin improvement in service and other businesses.

     Elon Musk (49:54):

Traditional car production system.
     They're really doing about as good as possible to do within a conventional scenario.
     Trying to get much below 30 seconds is extremely difficult, but if not… And you start getting into impossible… Where you have to be faster than a human could possibly move.
     Then the autonomous line, it really just needs to be robots moving really fast and that's where it gets us up five seconds.
     But we'll start off with getting a C… Instead of an A getting a C in a new architecture, but then the potential is there over time to move that up to an A+ within an A+ architecture.
     Travis Axelrod (50:49):

Great.
     Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic risks in the form of tariffs, political biases, et cetera.
     Speaker 3 (50:59):

As Elon said, we've been a supply chain team for a while.
     We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts, supplying near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai.
     For example, in North America, our high volume vehicle programs have over 85% North American content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local content on similar levels of regionalization as North America when you exclude the battery.
     And we are working on regionalizing the battery as well.
     (51:34)
This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, tool sourcing, vertical integration, advanced analytics and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production stability.
     Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tariffs are higher on our low volume platforms than the high volume ones.
     Elon Musk (51:58):

Yeah.

Fantastic, thank you very much [inaudible 00:27:56].
     Now we will move on investor questions.
     We will start with questions from say.com.
     The first question is, what are the highest risk items on the critical path to Robotaxi launch and scaling?
-----
28. [Sentence #2966, TSLA_Q1_2025] [PLAN]
     And George, did you have a follow up?
     George (01:15:27):

My follow up is about geographic expansion.
     Just maybe discuss additional markets.
     There's been some news around India recently that you could launch this year and next.
     Thank you.
     Vaibhav Taneja (01:15:38):

So yeah, we've been working on getting into India.
     India is a very hot market.
>>> And especially the current, and I don't want to talk just about tariffs, but the current structure with India is that any car which we send in is subject to 70% tariff.
     Also on a 30% luxury tax on it.
     So the same car which we're selling is 100% more expensive than what it is.
     So that creates a lot of anxiety, is people feel okay, they're paying too much for the car.
     And by the way, we are not getting the money, the local government is getting the money.
     And that's why we've been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time.
     Like I said, we are working on it, it would be a great market to enter, because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in, and that is the market which we want to be in.
     But again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension, which we're trying to work around.
-----
29. [Sentence #2392, TSLA_Q1_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     (07:45)
So that's, I'd encourage people to look beyond some sort of bumps and bundles of each road immediately ahead of us.
     Lift your gaze to the bright shining sort of down the hill, I don't know, some Reagan-esque imagery.
     And that's where we're headed and not too distant future like I said.
     Kind of next year or two.
     So, let's see.
     (08:35)
With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains.
     This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
>>> So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects.
     I mean, it remains to be seen.
     Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
     But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
     So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.
     (09:50)
And undoubtedly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
     I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision.
     I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.

30. [Sentence #3247, TSLA_Q2_2025] [UNCERTAIN]
     On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved 14%.
     This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
     This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
     We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L.
     Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive and less in energy.
     However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
     So costs will increase in the near term.
>>> While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
     The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
     We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
     Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
     Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
     The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
     The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
     This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.
