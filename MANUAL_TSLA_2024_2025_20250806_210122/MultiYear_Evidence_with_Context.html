    Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we&#x27;re trying to ramp up production with 
Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards.

    These expenses flow through R&amp;D.
    We believe, even in the current environment, it is the right strategy making investments in these areas to position 
us for the long term.
    These increases were offset by decreases and the CNA from changes in our molecular flow program.

Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis.
    The primary reason was … well, Bitcoin mark-to-market loss in Q1 versus gain in Q4 resulting in a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">472</span> million drop.
    The remainder of the change is because of FX .
    With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in our other income
in addition to the FX .
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; I know tariffs is the hottest topic, which people talk about, and it has various impacts to our business.</span>
    As Elon mentioned, on the wake business, we&#x27;ve been on this journey of regionalization for years.
    Specifically in the US, Model Y has been rated the most American made car on cars.com made in America index three 
years in a row.
    This, in part, is of all the work which team has been doing over the years, and to the extent that today, if you 
look at our vehicle lineup in US, where about approximately, on a weighted average basis, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">85</span>% USMCA compliant.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span><span style="color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold">24:57</span><span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>
So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the 
tariffs, but we&#x27;re not immune, because when the Section <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">232</span> auto tariffs become effective in May, which includes Canada 
and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization , they will have an impact on profitability.
    And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand give or , which is pretty much in 
line with what we&#x27;ve been forecasting.
    The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China.
    We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US, 
however, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity .

    We published a vehicle safety report earlier today.
    You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD.
    We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend.
    Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really 
increase.
    On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%.
    This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
    This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, 
despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&amp;L.</span>
    Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in 
automotive and less in energy.
    However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
    So costs will increase in the near term.
    While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
    We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
    Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.

    So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most 
respects.
    I mean, it remains to be seen.
    Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
    But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
    So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

And undoubtedly, I&#x27;m going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff 
decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
    I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it&#x27;s up to him, of

Now let me walk you through why I&#x27;m so excited about the future of Tesla.
    So, first of all, autonomy.
    The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June.
    Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin.
    And then … Actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what&#x27;s the 
Cybercab because we&#x27;ve got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is 
autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi.
    It&#x27;s very confusing.

    Yeah, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs to give people time to 
adjust, otherwise, I quote, you said, <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&quot;The system would break and bad things would happen.&quot;</span>
    So are things breaking yet?
    And if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?
    Elon Musk <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span><span style="color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold">01:21:33</span><span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>:

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I&#x27;m one of many advisors to the president, I&#x27;m not the president.
    But I&#x27;ve made my opinion clear to the president, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.
    He talks to many people and he makes his decision.
    And I&#x27;m hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of 
others, and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future, which we&#x27;ll see.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally I&#x27;m an advocate for pre-trade and lower tariffs.</span>
    Now one does need to take a look at if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or if a government is 
providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that.
    But I think that that&#x27;s on a case by case basis, strategically.
    But the president is the elected representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would 
like to do.

Now let me walk you through why I&#x27;m so excited about the future of Tesla.
    So, first of all, autonomy.
    The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June.
    Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin.
    And then … Actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what&#x27;s the 
Cybercab because we&#x27;ve got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is 
autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi.
    It&#x27;s very confusing.
    So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we&#x27;ve made is capable of being a robotaxi or robotic taxi.

With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply 
chains.
    This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains 
be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
    So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most 
respects.
    I mean, it remains to be seen.
    Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
    But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
    So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

    I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it&#x27;s up to him, of 
course, to make his decision.
    I&#x27;ve been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but
this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.
    So I&#x27;ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that&#x27;s all I can do.

    This, in part, is of all the work which team has been doing over the years, and to the extent that today, if you 
look at our vehicle lineup in US, where about approximately, on a weighted average basis, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">85</span>% USMCA compliant.

So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the 
tariffs, but we&#x27;re not immune, because when the Section <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">232</span> auto tariffs become effective in May, which includes Canada 
and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization , they will have an impact on profitability.
    And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand give or , which is pretty much in 
line with what we&#x27;ve been forecasting.
    The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China.
    We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US, 
however, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity .

We&#x27;ve also been working on securing additional supply chain from non- China-based suppliers, but it will take time.
    Also note that  irrespective of all the impact on US from tariffs on the energy business, we do have mega-factory 
China, which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.</span>
    I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to  manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring 
equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
    And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

As Elon said, we&#x27;ve been a supply chain team for a while.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts, supplying </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai.</span>
    For example, in North America, our high volume vehicle programs have over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">85</span>% North American content and Shanghai 
vehicles have over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">95</span>% local content on similar levels of regionalization as North America when you exclude the battery.

This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, tool sourcing, 
vertical integration, advanced analytics and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production 
stability.
    Having said that, we are not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% insulated and these tariffs are higher on our low volume platforms than the high

Hi.
    Thank you very much for the question.
    So I wanted to ask about the optimist supply chain, going forward.
    You mentioned very fast ramp up.
    What do you envision that supply chain looking like?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the US now because of the tariffs?</span>
    How does one think about what needs to happen there?

We have to see how things settle out.
    I don&#x27;t know yet.
    Some things we&#x27;re doing as we already talked about, which is that we&#x27;ve already taken tremendous steps to localize 
our supply chain.
    We&#x27;re more localized than any other manufacturer, and we have a lot of things underway to increase the localization,
to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty.
    Did you have followup, Edison?

    While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
    We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
    Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
    Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
    The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
    The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.</span>
    The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage 
business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
    The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our 
best to try and manage through this.
    But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
    The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from 
supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.
    Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional 
expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute.
    Our operating expenses, especially R&amp;D-related spend, will continue to grow.
    We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to 
position us for the long term.

    You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD.
    We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend.
    Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really 
increase.
    On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%.
    This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
    This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, 
despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
    We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&amp;L.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">300</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">automotive and less in energy.</span>
    However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
    So costs will increase in the near term.
    While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.

We&#x27;ve also been working on securing additional supply chain from non- China-based suppliers, but it will take time.
    Also note that  irrespective of all the impact on US from tariffs on the energy business, we do have mega-factory 
China, which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US.
    There&#x27;s also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.
    I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to  manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring 
equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
    And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

Exactly.
    And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this .
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our CapEx , inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be </span>

    We are still evaluating what more to do on this one.
    To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and brand image.
    We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner, and this is the 
reason we&#x27;re still focused on bringing cheaper models to market soon, which start of production still planned for June.
    Additionally, the advancement in FSD related features, including pilot Robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, 
should help create a new area of demand.

    Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
    Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
    Thanks for taking the questions.
    First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.
    You&#x27;ve leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">tariffs in Europe.</span>
    Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff 
side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being 
imported from China into Europe.
    While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second 
round.
    They visited our factory.
    They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.

    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping </span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">goods.</span>
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

    Thank you very much.
    The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we&#x27;ll move on to the next 
one.
    What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
    Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
    I think we need to see just where things stand after the election.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico.</span>
    So it doesn&#x27;t make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
    So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically.
    However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly.
    And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.

    Our operating expenses, especially R&amp;D-related spend, will continue to grow.
    We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to 
position us for the long term.
    Other income grew sequentially primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Redcom Holdings, which was a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">284</span> 
million gain in Q2, while we got a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">125</span> million loss in Q1.
    Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price.

    We continue to make investments in various aspects of that fashion, like Cybertruck, semi lines, and other 
infrastructure spend and the expansion of our AI initiatives.

Hi, good evening.
    Thanks for taking the questions.
    First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.
    You&#x27;ve leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.
    But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of 
tariffs in Europe.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs.</span>
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff 
side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being 
imported from China into Europe.
    While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second 
round.
    They visited our factory.
    They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.
    As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe.

As Elon said, we&#x27;ve been a supply chain team for a while.
    We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing parts, supplying 
near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai.
    For example, in North America, our high volume vehicle programs have over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">85</span>% North American content and Shanghai 
vehicles have over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">95</span>% local content on similar levels of regionalization as North America when you exclude the battery.
    And we are working on regionalizing the battery as well.

This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic through supply diversification, tool sourcing, 
vertical integration, advanced analytics and local partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience and production 
stability.
    Having said that, we are not <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% insulated and these tariffs are higher on our low volume platforms than the high 
volume ones.

    There&#x27;s also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.
    I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to  manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring 
equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
    And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

Exactly.
    And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this .
    Our CapEx , inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be 
still in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> billion this year.

    We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner, and this is the 
reason we&#x27;re still focused on bringing cheaper models to market soon, which start of production still planned for June.
    Additionally, the advancement in FSD related features, including pilot Robotaxi launch in Austin later this year,

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">that any car which we send in is subject to </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">70</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">% tariff.</span>
    Also on a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% luxury tax on it.

    So that creates a lot of anxiety, is people feel okay, they&#x27;re paying too much for the car.
    And by the way, we are not getting the money, the local government is getting the money.
    And that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time.
    Like I said, we are working on it, it would be a great market to enter, because India has a big middle class, which 
we would want to tap in, and that is the market which we want to be in.

So that&#x27;s, I&#x27;d encourage people to look beyond some sort of bumps and bundles of each road immediately ahead of us.
    Lift your gaze to the bright shining sort of down the hill, I don&#x27;t know, some Reagan-esque imagery.
    And that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed and not too distant future like I said.
    Kind of next year or two.
    So, let&#x27;s see.

With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply 
chains.
    This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains 
be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">respects.</span>
    I mean, it remains to be seen.
    Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
    But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
    So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

And undoubtedly, I&#x27;m going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff 
decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
    I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it&#x27;s up to him, of 
course, to make his decision.
    I&#x27;ve been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but
this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.

    On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%.
    This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
    This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, 
despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
    We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&amp;L.
    Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in 
automotive and less in energy.
    However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
    So costs will increase in the near term.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.</span>
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
    We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
    Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
    Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
    The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
    The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
    This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts 
from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.
