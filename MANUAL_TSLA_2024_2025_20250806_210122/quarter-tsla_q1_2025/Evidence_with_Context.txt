[TSLA_Q1_2025] tariffs

1. [Sentence #160] [PLAN]
     These expenses flow through R&D.
     We believe, even in the current environment, it is the right strategy making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.
     These increases were offset by decreases and the CNA from changes in our molecular flow program.
     (23:41)
Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis.
     The primary reason was … well, Bitcoin mark-to-market loss in Q1 versus gain in Q4 resulting in a 472 million drop.
     The remainder of the change is because of FX [inaudible 00:24:00].
     With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in our other income in addition to the FX [inaudible 00:24:10].
>>> I know tariffs is the hottest topic, which people talk about, and it has various impacts to our business.
     As Elon mentioned, on the wake business, we've been on this journey of regionalization for years.
     Specifically in the US, Model Y has been rated the most American made car on cars.com made in America index three years in a row.
     This, in part, is of all the work which team has been doing over the years, and to the extent that today, if you look at our vehicle lineup in US, where about approximately, on a weighted average basis, 85% USMCA compliant.
     (24:57)
So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the tariffs, but we're not immune, because when the Section 232 auto tariffs become effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization [inaudible 00:25:19], they will have an impact on profitability.
     And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand give or [inaudible 00:25:27], which is pretty much in line with what we've been forecasting.
     The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China.
     We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US, however, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity [inaudible 00:25:56].

2. [Sentence #68] [UNCERTAIN]
     So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects.
     I mean, it remains to be seen.
     Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
     But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
     So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.
     (09:50)
And undoubtedly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
     I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision.
>>> I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.
     So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do.
     (10:38)
Now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla.
     So, first of all, autonomy.
     The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June.
     Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin.
     And then … Actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what's the Cybercab because we've got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi.
     It's very confusing.

3. [Sentence #707] [UNCERTAIN]
     Yeah, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs to give people time to adjust, otherwise, I quote, you said, "The system would break and bad things would happen."
     So are things breaking yet?
     And if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?
     Elon Musk (01:21:33):

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I'm one of many advisors to the president, I'm not the president.
     But I've made my opinion clear to the president, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.
     He talks to many people and he makes his decision.
     And I'm hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of others, and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future, which we'll see.
>>> But I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally I'm an advocate for pre-trade and lower tariffs.
     Now one does need to take a look at if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or if a government is providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that.
     But I think that that's on a case by case basis, strategically.
     But the president is the elected representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would like to do.
     Adam Jonas (01:23:09):

Okay, Elon, I respect that.
     Just as a follow-up, and thanks again, between China and the United States, who in your opinion is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids?
     And also drones, I'd be interested.
     And is it even close?

     It's very confusing.
     So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robotaxi or robotic taxi.

     (08:35)
With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply chains.
     This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
     So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most respects.
     I mean, it remains to be seen.
     Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.

     (25:56)
We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non- China-based suppliers, but it will take time.
     Also note that [inaudible 00:26:07] irrespective of all the impact on US from tariffs on the energy business, we do have mega-factory China, which just started operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US.
>>> There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.
     I know this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to [inaudible 00:26:35] manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the US, because there is not that much capacity in US.
     And current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subject to-

Elon Musk (26:48):

The expense is bringing it in from China right now.
     Vaibhav Taneja (26:49):

Exactly.
     And the reality is that China has the basic one which has the most capacity to provide this [inaudible 00:27:01].
     Our CapEx [inaudible 00:27:05], inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we have tried to do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of 10 billion this year.
     We are still evaluating what more to do on this one.
     To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and brand image.

     And that's where we're headed and not too distant future like I said.

     That's where we continue to focus on affordability and it's a fundamental focus there.
     Travis Axelrod (01:00:17):

Yeah.
     Fantastic.
     Thank you, guys.
     The next question is regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line.
     Could you confirm if it is currently operational?
     If so, what is the current production rate of Optimus bots per week?
>>> Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production line moving forward?
     Elon Musk (01:00:40):

I just want to emphasize, Optimus is still very much a development program.
     It's not a large volume production.
     That's why this year we will make a few.
     We do expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going be at the end of the year.
     Almost everything in Optimus is new.
     There's not an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really almost anything in the Optimus, apart from the Tesla AI computer, which is the same as one in the car.
     (01:01:26)
When you have a new complex manufactured product, it'll move as fast as the slowest and least lucky component in the entire thing.
