    These expenses flow through R&amp;D.

    The remainder of the change is because of FX .
    With the adoption of the new mark-to-market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in our other income

    As Elon mentioned, on the wake business, we&#x27;ve been on this journey of regionalization for years.
    Specifically in the US, Model Y has been rated the most American made car on cars.com made in America index three 
years in a row.
    This, in part, is of all the work which team has been doing over the years, and to the extent that today, if you 
look at our vehicle lineup in US, where about approximately, on a weighted average basis, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">85</span>% USMCA compliant.

So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the 
tariffs, but we&#x27;re not immune, because when the Section <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">232</span> auto tariffs become effective in May, which includes Canada 
and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of our regionalization , they will have an impact on profitability.
    And I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand give or , which is pretty much in 
line with what we&#x27;ve been forecasting.
    The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from China.
    We are in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US, 
however, the equipment which we have can only service a fraction of our total installed capacity .

    So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most 
respects.
    I mean, it remains to be seen.
    Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.
    But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
    So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

And undoubtedly, I&#x27;m going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff 
decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
    I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it&#x27;s up to him, of

Now let me walk you through why I&#x27;m so excited about the future of Tesla.
    So, first of all, autonomy.
    The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June.
    Unsupervised autonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin.
    And then … Actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what&#x27;s the 
Cybercab because we&#x27;ve got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is 
autonomous is a robotic taxi or robotaxi.
    It&#x27;s very confusing.

    Yeah, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs to give people time to 
adjust, otherwise, I quote, you said, <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&quot;The system would break and bad things would happen.&quot;</span>
    So are things breaking yet?
    And if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?
    Elon Musk <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span><span style="color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold">01:21:33</span><span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>:

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I&#x27;m one of many advisors to the president, I&#x27;m not the president.
    But I&#x27;ve made my opinion clear to the president, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.
    He talks to many people and he makes his decision.
    And I&#x27;m hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of 
others, and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future, which we&#x27;ll see.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally I&#x27;m an advocate for pre-trade and lower tariffs.</span>
    Now one does need to take a look at if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or if a government is 
providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that.
    But I think that that&#x27;s on a case by case basis, strategically.
    But the president is the elected representative of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would 
like to do.

Okay, Elon, I respect that.

With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply 
chains.
    This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains 
be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.

Yeah, hi.
    Yeah, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs to give people time to 
adjust, otherwise, I quote, you said, <span style="color: #008000; text-decoration-color: #008000">&quot;The system would break and bad things would happen.&quot;</span>
    So are things breaking yet?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?</span>

Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I&#x27;m one of many advisors to the president, I&#x27;m not the president.
    But I&#x27;ve made my opinion clear to the president, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.
    He talks to many people and he makes his decision.
    And I&#x27;m hopeful that the President will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions of 
others, and perhaps weigh my advice differently in the future, which we&#x27;ll see.
    But I&#x27;m an advocate of predictable tariff structures, and generally I&#x27;m an advocate for pre-trade and lower tariffs.
    Now one does need to take a look at if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or if a government is 
providing extreme financial support for a particular industry, then you have to do something to counteract that.
    But I think that that&#x27;s on a case by case basis, strategically.

Okay, Elon, I respect that.
    Just as a follow-up, and thanks again, between China and the United States, who in your opinion is further ahead on 
the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids?
    And also drones, I&#x27;d be interested.
    And is it even close?
    Yeah, I&#x27;m serious, and .

    And that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed and not too distant future like I said.
    Kind of next year or two.
    So, let&#x27;s see.

With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been working on for several years is to localize supply 
chains.
    This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the supply chains 
be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.
    So we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect to tariffs, at least in most 
respects.
    I mean, it remains to be seen.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low.</span>
    But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China.
    So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

And undoubtedly, I&#x27;m going to get a lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff 
decision is entirely up to the President of the United States.
    I will weigh in with my advice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it&#x27;s up to him, of 
course, to make his decision.
    I&#x27;ve been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but
this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President of the United States.
    So I&#x27;ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that&#x27;s all I can do.

Now let me walk you through why I&#x27;m so excited about the future of Tesla.

    That&#x27;s where we continue to focus on affordability and it&#x27;s a fundamental focus there.

Yeah.
    Fantastic.
    Thank you, guys.
    The next question is regarding the Tesla Optimus pilot line.
    Could you confirm if it is currently operational?
    If so, what is the current production rate of Optimus bots per week?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production line moving forward?</span>
    Elon Musk <span style="font-weight: bold">(</span><span style="color: #00ff00; text-decoration-color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold">01:00:40</span><span style="font-weight: bold">)</span>:

I just want to emphasize, Optimus is still very much a development program.
    It&#x27;s not a large volume production.
    That&#x27;s why this year we will make a few.
    We do expect to make thousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going be at the end of the year.
    Almost everything in Optimus is new.
    There&#x27;s not an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really almost anything in 
the Optimus, apart from the Tesla AI computer, which is the same as one in the car.

When you have a new complex manufactured product, it&#x27;ll move as fast as the slowest and least lucky component in the 
entire thing.
