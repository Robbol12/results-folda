[TSLA_Q2_2025] tariffs

1. [Sentence #183] [UNCERTAIN]
     We published a vehicle safety report earlier today.
     You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD.
     We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend.
     Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really increase.
     On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved 14%.
     This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
     This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
>>> We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L.
     Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive and less in energy.
     However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
     So costs will increase in the near term.
     While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
     The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
     We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
     Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.

     Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
     Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
     The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
     The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
>>> This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.
     The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
     The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our best to try and manage through this.
     But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
     The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.
     Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute.
     Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow.
     We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.

     Vaibhav Taneja noted that federal budget legislation has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
     TAKEAWAYS
Robotaxi Launch and Expansion: Tesla (TSLA 4.30%) launched its first commercial robotaxi service in Austin with paying customers and the company has a goal of expanding the service to cover half the U.S. population by the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.
     Robotaxi Miles and Safety Metrics: Ashok Elluswamy disclosed Robotaxis in Austin have exceeded 7,000 miles with no notable safety-critical interventions as of Q2 2025.
     Autonomous Ride-Hailing Rollout: Expansion to markets including the San Francisco Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida is pending regulatory approval as of Q2 2025, with service areas in Austin planned to expand more than tenfold.
     FSD Adoption Acceleration: Since the move to FSD version 12 in North America, FSD subscription rates have increased by 45%, and overall penetration has increased by 25% since the release of FSD 12 and B-38 in North America.
     Model Y Performance: Model Y became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria in June; it remains, per Musk, "the best-selling car of any kind in the world."
     Automotive Revenue Growth: Automotive revenue rose 19% sequentially on a 14% increase in deliveries, primarily due to improved average selling prices (“ASPs”) from new Model Y sales and a favorable mix, despite a reduction in regulatory credit revenue.
>>> Tariffs Impact: Tariff costs increased by approximately $300 million sequentially, with two-thirds impacting the automotive segment and further increases anticipated in subsequent quarters due to manufacturing and sales cycle latency.
     Automotive Product Portfolio: Production of lower-cost models began as planned in the first half; The ramp will occur in Q3 2025 and proceed more slowly than initially expected due to the focus on maximizing deliveries before the EV credit expires.
     Energy Business Performance: The company achieved record power deployment in Q2 2025, with sequential improvement in energy and solar margins, and attained the highest gross profit for the segment to date.
     Energy Business Tariff and Legislative Headwinds: Despite headwinds from tariffs and early expiration of consumer credits, customers -- especially in industrial storage -- have been willing to absorb some tariff impacts.
     Operating Expenses: Operating expenses grew sequentially on higher R&D investment in AI, greater stock-based compensation, and depreciation from AI compute infrastructure, with expectations for continued growth in these areas.
     Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was $146 million, as increased operating cash flows were offset by higher capital expenditures.
     CapEx Outlook: Management expects capital expenditures to exceed $9 billion for 2025.
     Regulatory Credit Revenue Decline: A legislative change eliminating emission penalties is expected to reduce new regulatory credit revenue quickly, per DevOps Ninja.

     Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow.
     We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term.
     Other income grew sequentially primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Redcom Holdings, which was a $284 million gain in Q2, while we got a $125 million loss in Q1.
     Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price.
     While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free cash flow.
     We continue to make investments in various aspects of that fashion, like Cybertruck, semi lines, and other infrastructure spend and the expansion of our AI initiatives.
     Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion.
>>> To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs.
     However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics, and our lead in energy set us up for a bright future.
     I would like to thank the whole Tesla, Inc. team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for their continued belief in us.
     Travis Axelrod: Great.
     Thanks very much, DevOps Ninja.
     So now we're going to move on to Say.com questions.
     The first question is, can you give us some insight into how robotaxis have been performing so far?
     And what rate do you expect to expand in terms of vehicles, geofence, cities, and supervisors?

     Supercharging and Service Profitability: Supercharging, insurance, and service centers all contributed to sequential margin improvement in service and other businesses.
