    We published a vehicle safety report earlier today.
    You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD.
    We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend.
    Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really 
increase.
    On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%.
    This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
    This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, 
despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&amp;L.</span>
    Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in 
automotive and less in energy.
    However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
    So costs will increase in the near term.
    While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
    We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
    Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.

    Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
    The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
    The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.</span>
    The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage 
business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
    The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our 
best to try and manage through this.
    But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
    The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from 
supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.
    Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional 
expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute.
    Our operating expenses, especially R&amp;D-related spend, will continue to grow.
    We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to 
position us for the long term.

energy and solar margins, and attained the highest gross profit for the segment to date.
    Energy Business Tariff and Legislative Headwinds: Despite headwinds from tariffs and early expiration of consumer 
credits, customers -- especially in industrial storage -- have been willing to absorb some tariff impacts.
    Operating Expenses: Operating expenses grew sequentially on higher R&amp;D investment in AI, greater stock-based 
compensation, and depreciation from AI compute infrastructure, with expectations for continued growth in these areas.
    Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">146</span> million, as increased operating cash flows were offset by higher capital 
expenditures.
    CapEx Outlook: Management expects capital expenditures to exceed $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span> billion for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.

    We continue to make investments in various aspects of that fashion, like Cybertruck, semi lines, and other

    Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">146</span> million, as increased operating cash flows were offset by higher capital 
expenditures.
    CapEx Outlook: Management expects capital expenditures to exceed $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">9</span> billion for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    Regulatory Credit Revenue Decline: A legislative change eliminating emission penalties is expected to reduce new 
regulatory credit revenue quickly, per DevOps Ninja.
    Optimus Production Timeline: Elon Musk projected prototypes of the Optimus three humanoid robot within three months 
and planned start of production early next year, with a medium-confidence target of ramping to about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units per 
month within five years.
    Dojo and AI Infrastructure: Musk said Dojo two will be operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being 
somewhere around a hundred k h one hundred equivalent, and a new AI factory will hopefully be in production around the 
end of next year.
    Supercharging and Service Profitability: Supercharging, insurance, and service centers all contributed to sequential
margin improvement in service and other businesses.

    On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue 
increased by <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">19</span>% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>%.
    This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
    This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, 
despite an increase in cost of tariffs.
    We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&amp;L.
    Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in 
automotive and less in energy.
    However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.
    So costs will increase in the near term.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.</span>
    The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily 
due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins.
    We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet.
    Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter.
    Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth.
    The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry.
    The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
    This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts 
from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts.

    The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage 
business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our </span>

    But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
    The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from 
supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability.
    Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional 
expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute.
    Our operating expenses, especially R&amp;D-related spend, will continue to grow.
    We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to 
position us for the long term.
    Other income grew sequentially primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Redcom Holdings, which was a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">284</span> 
million gain in Q2, while we got a $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">125</span> million loss in Q1.
    Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price.
