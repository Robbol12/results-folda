[Year 2025] Comanche Peak

1. [Sentence #683, VST_Q2_2025_transcript] [PLAN]
     David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
     I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
     And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.
     I'm curious just is there anything else that's needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
     I think previously, you had characterized SB 6 as one of the key elements there.
     Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is still somewhat in flux.
     Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
     James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
     So SB 6 was an important piece of legislation.
     I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that's where the backup generation piece was highlighted.
     Our project had already been filed and is already subject and we believe meets the requirements of all existing ERCOT large load interconnect processes.
     We think it meets the requirements of any new process.
     But to your point, there's still a bit undetermined about the new process.
     There's been a workshop.
     There's been an open meeting here recently.
     Our feeling is that the approach we've taken from the initial construct of this deal and working with our partner to where it sits today is that a binding deal signed before September 1 is not subject to the new SP 6 process and we're already underway in that process.
     But if there were requirements that came out of SB 6, we feel confident our project meets that.
     So we don't view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
     I just think it's a process, and we've been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
     So again, that's all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
     I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
     I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
>>> Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?
     Or are there other opportunities?
     And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get color on?
     James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn't specific just to Comanche Peak.
     As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced activities.
     We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we're working across the fleet on front of the meter and co-located deals.
     I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options they're evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
     So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by year-end.
     But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
     I appreciate that.
     And then maybe on the M&A front, I know you have something pending right now.
     Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
     And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
     James A. Burke

It's a good question, Michael.
     We don't see it as precluding.
     This was not -- on a percentage basis, this was not as large a deal as obviously some of what our peers recently announced.
     We had done bigger deals earlier.
     You might remember, we were -- we started this with the acquisition of Dynegy way back when and when prices were even lower from an asset standpoint than today.
     And then, of course, Energy Harbor and then this one.
     I do think there are going to be specific tests that obviously regulators will look at in specific pockets, but we think that's manageable.
     There's plenty of assets that are of interest to us.
     We have headroom in the major markets, including the major PJM markets as well as ERCOT.
     So we expect to be in the discussions and in the evaluation of future opportunities.

     Moving to the balance sheet, Vistra's net leverage ratio is currently approximately 3x adjusted EBITDA.
     While current leverage levels have remained approximately 3x for the last few quarters, we continue to expect our ratio to decline materially beginning in 2026 as we realized higher levels of EBITDA, in line with our outlook, meet payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Vistra Vision minority interest and allocate additional cash to incremental growth or additional debt repayments.
     We remain committed to maintaining very strong leverage metrics, which we believe, when coupled with the expected stability and diversity of our earnings will position us for an upgrade to investment-grade credit ratings in the next 12 to 18 months.
     Finally,

turning to organic growth.
     We expect to invest just over $700 million on solar and energy storage projects in 2025, including the previously discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft.
     Consistent with comments made last quarter, we anticipate a significant reduction in solar and energy storage development CapEx for 2026.
     As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
     As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation types within our fleet.
     We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
     In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value creation.
     As always, the team remains laser-focused on executing against our 4 strategic priorities in this growing demand backdrop.
     With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
     David Keith Arcaro

First, I thought could we start on Comanche Peak.
     I was wondering if you could just comment on how is the potential deal at Comanche Peak progressing and latest thoughts on timing there and any gating factors as you look at that opportunity?
     James A. Burke

David, I somehow knew this one was coming.
     So I appreciate you asking it.
     It's an important topic.
     Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
     I think that's been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
     And it's important that we've been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
     So in my view, you're not done until you're done.
     And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
     And so it isn't just about price, it's also about terms.
>>> So given that background, there's been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.
     And while I'm not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
     I hope that's helpful color, David.
     I know there's going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
     The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.

     Jeremy Bryan Tonet

Maybe to put a bow on this part of the conversation with respect to contracting in general.
     Just wondering if we could kind of gauge the momentum here.
     Do you feel more confident in your full opportunity set across the portfolio now versus last quarter given developments we've seen over the past several months?
     James A. Burke

It is interesting that you're gauging it quarter-to-quarter because we do see conversations ebb and flow at times because, again, these large customers, and we're talking primarily the hyperscalers are pursuing multiple opportunities across the country and internationally.
     So getting their attention on certain deals comes and goes, and we'll see the team come into a conversation where we're talking about multiple deals and then it will go a little quiet and then even more deals come up for discussion in the aftermath of that.
     I can only assume our peers are seeing similar type reaction because these are complicated deals.
     Colocation, for instance, I describe it as sort of like having a permanent roommate.
     It's not a paper contract or a hedge, you're colocated, you're coordinating activities.

     As a result, starting in 2026 and we are increasing our targeted conversion rate of adjusted free cash flow before growth to adjusted EBITDA over the medium term to be at or above 60%.
     Based on this revised outlook, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of additional unallocated capital and as Jim mentioned, we have many options on how to deploy this capital.
     We plan to provide a more detailed update on unallocated cash available for allocation on our third quarter results call.
     Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 13.
     The share repurchase program remains an integral part of our capital allocation framework and has added significant value since the initial implementation in late 2021.
     Since beginning the program, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 164 million shares at an average price per share of just under $33.
     This reduction has led to a 50% increase in our dividend per share when comparing the dividend per share in Q4 2021 to the dividend per share paid in Q2 2025.
     Our [indiscernible] plan has allowed us to stay in the market even when in possession of material nonpublic information.
     The plan is designed to flex up or down based on multiple predetermined factors, including our share price.
     For example, in the second quarter, nearly 2/3 of the total share repurchases in the quarter were executed during the April market downturn, achieving an average price paid per share in that month of less than $115.
     Going forward, we expect to remain consistent buyers of our shares with the goal of leaning in during periods of market dislocation.
     Moving to the balance sheet, Vistra's net leverage ratio is currently approximately 3x adjusted EBITDA.
     While current leverage levels have remained approximately 3x for the last few quarters, we continue to expect our ratio to decline materially beginning in 2026 as we realized higher levels of EBITDA, in line with our outlook, meet payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Vistra Vision minority interest and allocate additional cash to incremental growth or additional debt repayments.

     I'm curious just is there anything else that's needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
     I think previously, you had characterized SB 6 as one of the key elements there.
     Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is still somewhat in flux.
     Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
     James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
     So SB 6 was an important piece of legislation.
     I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that's where the backup generation piece was highlighted.

     While current leverage levels have remained approximately 3x for the last few quarters, we continue to expect our ratio to decline materially beginning in 2026 as we realized higher levels of EBITDA, in line with our outlook, meet payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Vistra Vision minority interest and allocate additional cash to incremental growth or additional debt repayments.
     We remain committed to maintaining very strong leverage metrics, which we believe, when coupled with the expected stability and diversity of our earnings will position us for an upgrade to investment-grade credit ratings in the next 12 to 18 months.
     Finally,

turning to organic growth.
     We expect to invest just over $700 million on solar and energy storage projects in 2025, including the previously discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft.
     Consistent with comments made last quarter, we anticipate a significant reduction in solar and energy storage development CapEx for 2026.
     As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
     As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation types within our fleet.
     We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
     In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value creation.
     As always, the team remains laser-focused on executing against our 4 strategic priorities in this growing demand backdrop.
     With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
     David Keith Arcaro

First, I thought could we start on Comanche Peak.
     I was wondering if you could just comment on how is the potential deal at Comanche Peak progressing and latest thoughts on timing there and any gating factors as you look at that opportunity?
     James A. Burke

David, I somehow knew this one was coming.
     So I appreciate you asking it.
     It's an important topic.
     Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
     I think that's been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
     And it's important that we've been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
     So in my view, you're not done until you're done.
     And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
     And so it isn't just about price, it's also about terms.
     So given that background, there's been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.
>>> And while I'm not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
     I hope that's helpful color, David.
     I know there's going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
     The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
     David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
     I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
     And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.
     I'm curious just is there anything else that's needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
     I think previously, you had characterized SB 6 as one of the key elements there.
     Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is still somewhat in flux.
     Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
     James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
     So SB 6 was an important piece of legislation.
     I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that's where the backup generation piece was highlighted.
     Our project had already been filed and is already subject and we believe meets the requirements of all existing ERCOT large load interconnect processes.
     We think it meets the requirements of any new process.
     But to your point, there's still a bit undetermined about the new process.
     There's been a workshop.
     There's been an open meeting here recently.
     Our feeling is that the approach we've taken from the initial construct of this deal and working with our partner to where it sits today is that a binding deal signed before September 1 is not subject to the new SP 6 process and we're already underway in that process.
     But if there were requirements that came out of SB 6, we feel confident our project meets that.
     So we don't view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
     I just think it's a process, and we've been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
     So again, that's all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
     I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.

     Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
     I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
     Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?
     Or are there other opportunities?
     And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get color on?
     James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn't specific just to Comanche Peak.
>>> As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced activities.
     We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we're working across the fleet on front of the meter and co-located deals.
     I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options they're evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
     So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by year-end.
     But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
     I appreciate that.
     And then maybe on the M&A front, I know you have something pending right now.
     Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
     And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
     James A. Burke

It's a good question, Michael.
     We don't see it as precluding.
     This was not -- on a percentage basis, this was not as large a deal as obviously some of what our peers recently announced.
     We had done bigger deals earlier.
     You might remember, we were -- we started this with the acquisition of Dynegy way back when and when prices were even lower from an asset standpoint than today.
     And then, of course, Energy Harbor and then this one.
     I do think there are going to be specific tests that obviously regulators will look at in specific pockets, but we think that's manageable.
     There's plenty of assets that are of interest to us.
     We have headroom in the major markets, including the major PJM markets as well as ERCOT.
     So we expect to be in the discussions and in the evaluation of future opportunities.
     Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
     Jeremy Bryan Tonet

Maybe to put a bow on this part of the conversation with respect to contracting in general.
     Just wondering if we could kind of gauge the momentum here.
     Do you feel more confident in your full opportunity set across the portfolio now versus last quarter given developments we've seen over the past several months?
     James A. Burke

It is interesting that you're gauging it quarter-to-quarter because we do see conversations ebb and flow at times because, again, these large customers, and we're talking primarily the hyperscalers are pursuing multiple opportunities across the country and internationally.
-----
9. [Sentence #128, VST_Q1_2025_transcript] [PLAN]
     We expect to provide guidance for 2026 later in the year, likely on our third quarter call.
     As always, our guidance and near-term outlook remain supported by our comprehensive hedging program.
     For 2025, our gross margin remains highly hedged, with approximately 100% of our expected generation already sold.
     For 2026, our hedge ratio increased from approximately 80% to approximately 90% as our commercial team took advantage of market opportunities.
     Finally, turning to Slide 11, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan.
     Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 163 million shares at an average price per share of just under $32.
     This reduction has notably led to a 49% increase in our dividend per share since the dividend paid in Q4 2021 to the dividend paid in Q1 2025.
     Regarding our balance sheet, Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits just under 3x adjusted EBITDA in line with our long-term target of below 3x.
     In terms of future capital deployment, we will maintain a disciplined approach towards further deleveraging, investment for growth, and shareholder return.
     We expect to invest just over $700 million on solar and energy storage projects in 2025, including the previously discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft, along with our Newton site, which we began preparing for construction this quarter.
     Based on our current project pipeline, we anticipate a reduction in solar and energy storage development CapEx for 2026, subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
     As a reminder, we expect to fund a significant portion of our growth expenditures with third-party capital, including non-recourse loans.
     We continue to believe these projects are a great opportunity to leverage existing sites to increase the proportion of our contracted EBITDA at attractive returns while limiting the impact of our cash available for allocation.
     Lastly, we believe Vistra continues to be well-positioned to create sustained long-term value.
     The resilience of our business is evident in our strong results and reaffirmed earnings outlook amidst increased market volatility.
     Our team is focused on our core mission of lighting up lives and powering a better way forward.
     We remain confident in our ability to be part of the solution to address our country's growing power demand in the coming years, and we look forward to the months and years ahead.
     With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
     Please go ahead with your question.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Hey guys, good morning.
     Jim Burke

Hey, Shar, good morning.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Good morning, Jim.
     Jim, I couldn't get a sense on the preparations [ph].
>>> Just on Comanche Peak, deal conversations, are you waiting specifically for co-locations at this point or could you be moving ahead with front of the meter and virtual PPAs in the interim?
     And the reason why I ask is one of your peers noted yesterday that FOM and BTM pricing is harmonizing in their customer conversations, which I think is counter to what Vistra has been messaging in the past.
     So just a little bit of a sense there, thanks.
     Jim Burke

Sure.
     Well, Shar, I think what I've tried to mention on previous calls, and I know we've covered a lot of ground, really, for the past year's worth of calls, that no two deals really are going to look alike.
     I think the customer needs really dictate that.
     And for some areas of the country, the front of the meter may actually be as good of an opportunity set as co-location.
     From our perspective, when we've looked at the deals that we're working on with many customers, they're still looking at co-location as a potential speed advantage.
     And again, that's going to depend on which part of the country and how clear are the rules.
     I think from our team's perspective, the activity level has not slowed down.
     We remain very engaged with a number of these opportunities and we're very pleased with the progress we're making.
     There is still a desire for clarity because as we mentioned on previous calls, you have to contract through these deals, which are long-term deals, 10 to 20 years, and new contracts need to anticipate how rules and regulations are going to play out.
     So to the extent the rules and regulations can become clearer, it'll make the ease of contracting these, I think, a little bit more straightforward.
     As far as pricing, a lot of these customers look at alternatives around the country.
     So what is the next best alternative to either a front of the meter location or co-location with existing assets?
     And that includes co-location potentially with even new assets, all of that creates a price spectrum.
     And I think we've talked about the fact that there is going to be a spectrum of prices out there.
     I don't think there's enough deals signed to say that one deal is going to equal another deal because there just really, frankly, haven't been that many deals announced.
     And so I think it's too early to say that front of the meter and behind the meter is harmonizing from our perspective, but I also think no two deals are going to look exactly the same.
     And I don't think we should expect that.
     These are sophisticated customers.
     The markets all have different nuances in terms of their design and their ability to deliver for the customer.
     And I think our ability to price that is going to be our ability to work with that customer that we can meet their needs.
     And so what I'm excited about is that the hyperscalers have either reaffirmed or increased their CapEx.
     So we're still talking about nearly $2 trillion between now and 2030 that the major four players intend to spend.

     And the administration is prioritizing AI.
     They're setting a tone that we've got to win the AI race.
     So we've got to make co-location work.
     We've got to make front of the meter work.
     We need to be able to build new assets as well as utilize existing ones.
     And so that's how we're approaching it, sure.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Got it.
     That's actually very consistent in the past.
     And then, Jim, just lastly, I know this is not an easy question to answer, but just on general deal timeline at this point, does SB6 finalization, does that unlock a Comanche deal?
     Jim Burke

I think SB6, the end result of SB6 will unlock a lot of things.
     We don't know how SB6 is going to frankly turn out.
     I mean, there's a hearing today.
     It's the first time it's being picked up in the House.
     And as we've covered in previous calls, Texas could attract a lot of load if we're able to lay out clear rules and regulations.
>>> And I think that could unlock a Comanche Peak deal, but I think it could unlock a lot of deals, including front of the meter deals.
     SB6 deals with both.
     And so we're active on SB6 as are our peers, as is the large customer coalition is very active on this.
     So the session ends in early June.
     The goal obviously would be to get clarity around that time frame and I would expect that you will see some things announced shortly thereafter with the view that the deal parameters and the kinds of things that folks are trying to contract around would become more clear.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Got it.
     Perfect.
     Thanks again, Jim.
     Very helpful color.
     Appreciate it as always.
     Jim Burke

Thank you, Shar.
     Operator

Our next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies LLC.
     Please go ahead with your question.
     Julian Dumoulin-Smith

Hey, good morning, team.
     Thank you guys very much.
     Appreciate the time.
     Guys, maybe just to follow-up a little bit here on what you guys are saying about '26 here and $7 billion.
     Can you guys comment briefly on '27?
     I mean, the curve has been moving around.
     Obviously, the opportunities that you guys are seeing also moving around, but -- any shall we say initial commentary that you guys would really be willing to provide?
     Jim Burke

Julian, it has been I think I use the word turbulent in the prepared remark.
     So it is moving around.
     I think the good news is that that turbulence has showed strength before some of the concerns around the economy, and that has bounced back.
     And so our team has been actively hedging, as you've heard the update that Chris gave.
     And I think I mentioned on the last call, and Chris was giving a nod to this in his remarks, '26 is looking strong and we see '27 and even '28.
