    David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
    I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
    And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.
    I&#x27;m curious just is there anything else that&#x27;s needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
    I think previously, you had characterized SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> as one of the key elements there.
    Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is 
still somewhat in flux.
    Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
    James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
    So SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> was an important piece of legislation.
    I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the
meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that&#x27;s
where the backup generation piece was highlighted.
    Our project had already been filed and is already subject and we believe meets the requirements of all existing 
ERCOT large load interconnect processes.
    We think it meets the requirements of any new process.
    But to your point, there&#x27;s still a bit undetermined about the new process.
    There&#x27;s been a workshop.
    There&#x27;s been an open meeting here recently.
    Our feeling is that the approach we&#x27;ve taken from the initial construct of this deal and working with our partner to
where it sits today is that a binding deal signed before September <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> is not subject to the new SP <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> process and we&#x27;re 
already underway in that process.
    But if there were requirements that came out of SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>, we feel confident our project meets that.
    So we don&#x27;t view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
    I just think it&#x27;s a process, and we&#x27;ve been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
    So again, that&#x27;s all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
    I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
    I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?</span>
    Or are there other opportunities?
    And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get 
color on?
    James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn&#x27;t specific just to Comanche Peak.
    As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced
activities.
    We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we&#x27;re working across the fleet on front of the 
meter and co-located deals.
    I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options 
they&#x27;re evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
    So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by 
year-end.
    But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
    I appreciate that.
    And then maybe on the M&amp;A front, I know you have something pending right now.
    Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
    And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
    James A. Burke

It&#x27;s a good question, Michael.
    We don&#x27;t see it as precluding.
    This was not -- on a percentage basis, this was not as large a deal as obviously some of what our peers recently 
announced.
    We had done bigger deals earlier.
    You might remember, we were -- we started this with the acquisition of Dynegy way back when and when prices were 
even lower from an asset standpoint than today.
    And then, of course, Energy Harbor and then this one.
    I do think there are going to be specific tests that obviously regulators will look at in specific pockets, but we 
think that&#x27;s manageable.
    There&#x27;s plenty of assets that are of interest to us.
    We have headroom in the major markets, including the major PJM markets as well as ERCOT.
    So we expect to be in the discussions and in the evaluation of future opportunities.

    Moving to the balance sheet, Vistra&#x27;s net leverage ratio is currently approximately 3x adjusted EBITDA.
    While current leverage levels have remained approximately 3x for the last few quarters, we continue to expect our 
ratio to decline materially beginning in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span> as we realized higher levels of EBITDA, in line with our outlook, meet 
payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Vistra Vision minority interest and allocate additional cash to 
incremental growth or additional debt repayments.
    We remain committed to maintaining very strong leverage metrics, which we believe, when coupled with the expected 
stability and diversity of our earnings will position us for an upgrade to investment-grade credit ratings in the next 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span> months.
    Finally,

turning to organic growth.
    We expect to invest just over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">700</span> million on solar and energy storage projects in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, including the previously 
discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft.
    Consistent with comments made last quarter, we anticipate a significant reduction in solar and energy storage 
development CapEx for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
    As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation 
types within our fleet.
    We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these 
projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
    In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value 
creation.
    As always, the team remains laser-focused on executing against our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> strategic priorities in this growing demand 
backdrop.
    With that, operator, we&#x27;re ready to open the line for questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
    David Keith Arcaro

First, I thought could we start on Comanche Peak.
    I was wondering if you could just comment on how is the potential deal at Comanche Peak progressing and latest 
thoughts on timing there and any gating factors as you look at that opportunity?
    James A. Burke

David, I somehow knew this one was coming.
    So I appreciate you asking it.
    It&#x27;s an important topic.
    Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
    I think that&#x27;s been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
    And it&#x27;s important that we&#x27;ve been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data 
center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
    So in my view, you&#x27;re not done until you&#x27;re done.
    And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
    And so it isn&#x27;t just about price, it&#x27;s also about terms.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So given that background, there&#x27;s been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.</span>
    And while I&#x27;m not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about 
where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
    I hope that&#x27;s helpful color, David.
    I know there&#x27;s going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
    The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
    David Keith Arcaro

Got it.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
    Jeremy Bryan Tonet

Maybe to put a bow on this part of the conversation with respect to contracting in general.
    Just wondering if we could kind of gauge the momentum here.
    Do you feel more confident in your full opportunity set across the portfolio now versus last quarter given 
developments we&#x27;ve seen over the past several months?
    James A. Burke

It is interesting that you&#x27;re gauging it quarter-to-quarter because we do see conversations ebb and flow at times 
because, again, these large customers, and we&#x27;re talking primarily the hyperscalers are pursuing multiple opportunities 
across the country and internationally.
    So getting their attention on certain deals comes and goes, and we&#x27;ll see the team come into a conversation where 
we&#x27;re talking about multiple deals and then it will go a little quiet and then even more deals come up for discussion in
the aftermath of that.
    I can only assume our peers are seeing similar type reaction because these are complicated deals.
    Colocation, for instance, I describe it as sort of like having a permanent roommate.
    It&#x27;s not a paper contract or a hedge, you&#x27;re colocated, you&#x27;re coordinating activities.

    As a result, starting in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span> and we are increasing our targeted conversion rate of adjusted free cash flow before 
growth to adjusted EBITDA over the medium term to be at or above <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span>%.
    Based on this revised outlook, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of additional unallocated capital and as 
Jim mentioned, we have many options on how to deploy this capital.
    We plan to provide a more detailed update on unallocated cash available for allocation on our third quarter results 
call.
    Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span>.
    The share repurchase program remains an integral part of our capital allocation framework and has added significant 
value since the initial implementation in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>.
    Since beginning the program, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%, repurchasing approximately
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">164</span> million shares at an average price per share of just under $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">33</span>.
    This reduction has led to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% increase in our dividend per share when comparing the dividend per share in Q4 <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> 
to the dividend per share paid in Q2 <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>.
    Our  plan has allowed us to stay in the market even when in possession of material nonpublic information.
    The plan is designed to flex up or down based on multiple predetermined factors, including our share price.
    For example, in the second quarter, nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>/<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> of the total share repurchases in the quarter were executed during 
the April market downturn, achieving an average price paid per share in that month of less than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">115</span>.
    Going forward, we expect to remain consistent buyers of our shares with the goal of leaning in during periods of 
market dislocation.
    Moving to the balance sheet, Vistra&#x27;s net leverage ratio is currently approximately 3x adjusted EBITDA.
    While current leverage levels have remained approximately 3x for the last few quarters, we continue to expect our 
ratio to decline materially beginning in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span> as we realized higher levels of EBITDA, in line with our outlook, meet 
payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Vistra Vision minority interest and allocate additional cash to 
incremental growth or additional debt repayments.
    We remain committed to maintaining very strong leverage metrics, which we believe, when coupled with the expected 
stability and diversity of our earnings will position us for an upgrade to investment-grade credit ratings in the next 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">18</span> months.
    Finally,

turning to organic growth.
    We expect to invest just over $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">700</span> million on solar and energy storage projects in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span>, including the previously 
discussed solar projects supported by contracts with Amazon and Microsoft.
    Consistent with comments made last quarter, we anticipate a significant reduction in solar and energy storage 
development CapEx for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2026</span>.
    As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
    As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation 
types within our fleet.
    We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these 
projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
    In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value 
creation.
    As always, the team remains laser-focused on executing against our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> strategic priorities in this growing demand 
backdrop.
    With that, operator, we&#x27;re ready to open the line for questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; David Keith Arcaro</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">First, I thought could we start on Comanche Peak.</span>
    I was wondering if you could just comment on how is the potential deal at Comanche Peak progressing and latest 
thoughts on timing there and any gating factors as you look at that opportunity?
    James A. Burke

David, I somehow knew this one was coming.
    So I appreciate you asking it.
    It&#x27;s an important topic.
    Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
    I think that&#x27;s been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
    And it&#x27;s important that we&#x27;ve been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data 
center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
    So in my view, you&#x27;re not done until you&#x27;re done.
    And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
    And so it isn&#x27;t just about price, it&#x27;s also about terms.
    So given that background, there&#x27;s been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.
    And while I&#x27;m not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about 
where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
    I hope that&#x27;s helpful color, David.
    I know there&#x27;s going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
    The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
    David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
    I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
    And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.
    I&#x27;m curious just is there anything else that&#x27;s needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
    I think previously, you had characterized SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> as one of the key elements there.
    Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is 
still somewhat in flux.
    Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
    James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
    So SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> was an important piece of legislation.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">190</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    I&#x27;m curious just is there anything else that&#x27;s needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
    I think previously, you had characterized SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> as one of the key elements there.
    Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is 
still somewhat in flux.
    Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
    James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
    So SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> was an important piece of legislation.
    I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the
meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that&#x27;s
where the backup generation piece was highlighted.
    Our project had already been filed and is already subject and we believe meets the requirements of all existing 
ERCOT large load interconnect processes.
    We think it meets the requirements of any new process.
    But to your point, there&#x27;s still a bit undetermined about the new process.
    There&#x27;s been a workshop.
    There&#x27;s been an open meeting here recently.
    Our feeling is that the approach we&#x27;ve taken from the initial construct of this deal and working with our partner to
where it sits today is that a binding deal signed before September <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> is not subject to the new SP <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> process and we&#x27;re 
already underway in that process.
    But if there were requirements that came out of SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>, we feel confident our project meets that.
    So we don&#x27;t view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
    I just think it&#x27;s a process, and we&#x27;ve been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
    So again, that&#x27;s all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
    I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
    I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
    Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?
    Or are there other opportunities?
    And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get 
color on?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; James A. Burke</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Yes, Michael, that wasn&#x27;t specific just to Comanche Peak.</span>
    As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced
activities.
    We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we&#x27;re working across the fleet on front of the 
meter and co-located deals.
    I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options 
they&#x27;re evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
    So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by 
year-end.
    But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
    I appreciate that.
    And then maybe on the M&amp;A front, I know you have something pending right now.
    Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
    And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
    James A. Burke

It&#x27;s a good question, Michael.
    We don&#x27;t see it as precluding.
    This was not -- on a percentage basis, this was not as large a deal as obviously some of what our peers recently 
announced.
    We had done bigger deals earlier.
    You might remember, we were -- we started this with the acquisition of Dynegy way back when and when prices were 
even lower from an asset standpoint than today.
    And then, of course, Energy Harbor and then this one.
    I do think there are going to be specific tests that obviously regulators will look at in specific pockets, but we 
think that&#x27;s manageable.
    There&#x27;s plenty of assets that are of interest to us.
    We have headroom in the major markets, including the major PJM markets as well as ERCOT.
    So we expect to be in the discussions and in the evaluation of future opportunities.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
    Jeremy Bryan Tonet

Maybe to put a bow on this part of the conversation with respect to contracting in general.
    Just wondering if we could kind of gauge the momentum here.
    Do you feel more confident in your full opportunity set across the portfolio now versus last quarter given 
developments we&#x27;ve seen over the past several months?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Based on this revised outlook, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of additional unallocated capital and as 
Jim mentioned, we have many options on how to deploy this capital.
    We plan to provide a more detailed update on unallocated cash available for allocation on our third quarter results 
call.
    Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span>.
    The share repurchase program remains an integral part of our capital allocation framework and has added significant 
value since the initial implementation in late <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>.
    Since beginning the program, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>%, repurchasing approximately
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">164</span> million shares at an average price per share of just under $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">33</span>.
    This reduction has led to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% increase in our dividend per share when comparing the dividend per share in Q4 <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>

    And so it isn&#x27;t just about price, it&#x27;s also about terms.
    So given that background, there&#x27;s been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And while I&#x27;m not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.</span>
    I hope that&#x27;s helpful color, David.
    I know there&#x27;s going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
    The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
    David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
    I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
    And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.
    I&#x27;m curious just is there anything else that&#x27;s needed from a maybe Texas policy standpoint to move forward?
    I think previously, you had characterized SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> as one of the key elements there.
    Do you feel like you have everything you need in terms of regulatory clarity or the regulatory approval process is 
still somewhat in flux.
    Is that one of the next milestones that could determine the path forward?
    James A. Burke

Yes, David, it is.
    So SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> was an important piece of legislation.
    I think its primary focus was concern around large load growth and grid reliability and how will either front of the
meter or co-located deals contribute to providing reliability resources if a reliability event were to occur, and that&#x27;s
where the backup generation piece was highlighted.
    Our project had already been filed and is already subject and we believe meets the requirements of all existing 
ERCOT large load interconnect processes.
    We think it meets the requirements of any new process.
    But to your point, there&#x27;s still a bit undetermined about the new process.
    There&#x27;s been a workshop.
    There&#x27;s been an open meeting here recently.
    Our feeling is that the approach we&#x27;ve taken from the initial construct of this deal and working with our partner to
where it sits today is that a binding deal signed before September <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> is not subject to the new SP <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> process and we&#x27;re 
already underway in that process.
    But if there were requirements that came out of SB <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>, we feel confident our project meets that.
    So we don&#x27;t view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
    I just think it&#x27;s a process, and we&#x27;ve been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
    So again, that&#x27;s all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
    I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
    I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
    Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?
    Or are there other opportunities?
    And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get 
color on?
    James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn&#x27;t specific just to Comanche Peak.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">activities.</span>
    We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we&#x27;re working across the fleet on front of the 
meter and co-located deals.
    I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options 
they&#x27;re evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
    So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by 
year-end.
    But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
    I appreciate that.
    And then maybe on the M&amp;A front, I know you have something pending right now.
    Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
    And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
    James A. Burke

It&#x27;s a good question, Michael.
    We don&#x27;t see it as precluding.
    This was not -- on a percentage basis, this was not as large a deal as obviously some of what our peers recently 
announced.
    We had done bigger deals earlier.
    You might remember, we were -- we started this with the acquisition of Dynegy way back when and when prices were 
even lower from an asset standpoint than today.
    And then, of course, Energy Harbor and then this one.
    I do think there are going to be specific tests that obviously regulators will look at in specific pockets, but we 
think that&#x27;s manageable.
    There&#x27;s plenty of assets that are of interest to us.
    We have headroom in the major markets, including the major PJM markets as well as ERCOT.
    So we expect to be in the discussions and in the evaluation of future opportunities.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
    Jeremy Bryan Tonet

Maybe to put a bow on this part of the conversation with respect to contracting in general.
    Just wondering if we could kind of gauge the momentum here.
    Do you feel more confident in your full opportunity set across the portfolio now versus last quarter given 
developments we&#x27;ve seen over the past several months?
    James A. Burke

It is interesting that you&#x27;re gauging it quarter-to-quarter because we do see conversations ebb and flow at times 
because, again, these large customers, and we&#x27;re talking primarily the hyperscalers are pursuing multiple opportunities 
across the country and internationally.
