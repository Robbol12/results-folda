Thank you.
    The next question is, how well are <span class="r2">4680</span> cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day?
    How long will it be until the cells meet those goals?
    Drew?
    Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
    So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down road map through <span class="r2">2026</span> across five areas of effort.
    There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack concept, and the cell 
factory itself, and we&#x27;ve been making progress across all of these aspects since then.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the cell factory, the Texas </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> factory are partway through building and commissioning and selling and </span>
<span class="r5">operating will be </span><span class="r5">70</span><span class="r5">% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factories when fully ramped, in line with what we </span>
<span class="r5">described on Battery Day.</span>
    And we&#x27;re continuing to further pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory 
build-outs like in Nevada.
    On the cell design, we&#x27;re in production with not only the first generation tablet cell we unveiled on Battery Day, 
but a second more manufactural version in Texas today.
    On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Day road map.
    For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May.
    Our goal is to start commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year.
    The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic 
reagents, lower embodied energy.
    It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials.

    While we&#x27;re not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business 
will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we&#x27;ve seen historically on the vehicle business.
    We generally look to mid-<span class="r2">20</span>% gross margins for any program that we launch.
    And so we&#x27;re not there yet on this business, but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working towards.
    Elon Musk

We&#x27;re hopeful to get there later this year, but that&#x27;s not a promise.
    That&#x27;s an aspiration.

    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.</span>
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">200</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization?
    Are you just sort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there?
    Demand, obviously, isn&#x27;t the limitation.
    So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?
    Andrew Baglino

Sure.
    There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what&#x27;s going on in Lathrop.
    We actually had two phases of the CapEx there.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We phased some of the general assembly parts of the facility.</span>
    But in addition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side and on the 
power electronics side.
    And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with both those inputs.
    So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming online towards the end of this year.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    Great.
    And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out of Shanghai.
    Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocate more vehicles to Southeast
Asia, Australia, other areas.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">312</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    That&#x27;s going to be very compelling.
    This is just not the time to talk about it in details product.
    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.
    So, there will be a like a Model <span class="r2">3</span> or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.
    So, yes, that&#x27;s -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then maybe a question for Zach.</span>
    Back on the automotive gross margins.
    So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive 
gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
    Is it just the macro deteriorating?
    Is it the competitive landscape?
    Anything else that&#x27;s sort of like makes you think differently around the full year?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">135</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2024]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic 
reagents, lower embodied energy.
    It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials.
    We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.
    Same with cathode precursor, we&#x27;ve successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process 
that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this
technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility.
    On cathode production, we are <span class="r2">50</span>% equipment and <span class="r2">75</span>% utilities installed at our new cathode building in Austin, with 
our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarter with a target to produce first material before
the end of the year.
    Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell and the structural pack concept,
<span class="r2">50</span>% lower CapEx and <span class="r2">66</span>% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatt hours per year.
    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s simpler.</span>
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span class="r2">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span class="r2">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span class="r2">12</span>% and <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span class="r2">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span class="r2">12</span> months.
    And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the <span class="r2">4680</span> program as we steadily 
ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.

    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.</span>
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
    Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over <span class="r2">150</span> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving 
beta, and this number is growing exponentially.
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting

    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort

    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
    But it&#x27;s -- and unless there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to add, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I think that&#x27;s right.
    I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can&#x27;t get into the details 
of the reasons why certain decisions are made.
    But it is something that&#x27;s very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed.
    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">154</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
    And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, which is an input into 
our Austin COGS.
    And so, as the <span class="r2">4680</span> program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell 
portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
    A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It does not have </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.</span>
    And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost 
reduction in the Berlin factory as well.
    In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don&#x27;t need to rehash it, but the expectation is that 
every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there.
    There&#x27;s also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we&#x27;re 
aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.
    Within the world that we don&#x27;t control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in 
our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage 
of reduced spot rates where they can.
    So thank you to our supply chain team.
    And then there&#x27;s the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, 
two years or so, and we&#x27;re still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure.
    It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So just a Q1 recap.</span>
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.

    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span class="r2">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.

    What are your timelines for addressing some of those gaps in your regional exposure?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    That&#x27;s a good question because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet serve with respect to 
vehicles especially.
    So we do expect to open up new markets around the world.
    And while those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up to add a whole bunch of markets.
    They do collectively sum up to something significant.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we&#x27;re already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated a crash in the 
lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonate reductions into battery cost.
    And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide.
    The length of the supply chain matters also because what we&#x27;re talking about is very far upstream.
    So by the time it makes sense that battery that ends up in car.
    It will be several months.
    But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we&#x27;re also very focused on other metrics that make
production very efficient.
    So, for example, detention and demurrage air expedites.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think our air expedites are down </span><span class="r5">90</span><span class="r5">%.</span>
    Detention and demurrage is down <span class="r2">93</span>% from the peaks.
    That can be hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle.
    So we&#x27;re sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.
    Colin Rusch

Okay.
    And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale.
    I mean, obviously, there&#x27;s a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US.
    And can you talk about the volume of quotation you&#x27;re seeing at this point around stationary storage for the 
renewables queue on a global basis?

    Depending on what time scale you&#x27;re looking at, most of the car is variable.
    So most cost is variable.
    So -- and probably, if I were to guess, I think we will see improved costs from suppliers, yes, I think we will -- 
that is our expectation.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we&#x27;re already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated a crash in the 
lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonate reductions into battery cost.
    And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide.
    The length of the supply chain matters also because what we&#x27;re talking about is very far upstream.

    So hopefully, that helps answer your question.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    I mean there&#x27;s really two macro factors that are tricky.
    The biggest being the interest rate.
    So if there&#x27;s a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that is -- every time the Fed raise the interest
rates that&#x27;s equivalent to increasing the price of a car.
    It makes the cars less affordable because people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a 
monthly basis.
    So that&#x27;s -- so it&#x27;s just almost directly equivalent to a price increase, is there any kind of interest rate 
increase.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generally postpone new -- big, </span>
<span class="r5">new capital purchases like a new car.</span>
    This is a natural human reaction.
    So if people are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they&#x27;re like, well, they might be worried about -- 
they might be laid off.
    So then there&#x27;ll be naturally a little more hesitant than they would otherwise be to buy a new car.
    Now this is just the nature of the auto industry.
    But there is -- there will be a trans amount of pent-up demand for new cars.
    So it goes through cycles.

    Do you still see <span class="r2">2</span> million units as an upside case for volume this year?
    And is the gating factor for reaching <span class="r2">1.8</span> million or <span class="r2">2</span> million units in <span class="r2">2023</span> still supply chain, as was mentioned on
your last conference call, or is it more about demand at this point?
    Elon Musk

Well, if you have a crystal ball you can lend me back to the crystal ball situation.
    These are volatile times.
    From a production standpoint, if things go well, we&#x27;ve got a shot at <span class="r2">2</span> million vehicles this year.
    But that&#x27;s an upside case.
    And we feel comfortable with <span class="r2">1.8</span> million.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll have to see how this year unfolds.</span>
    Mark Delaney

That&#x27;s helpful.
    Thanks.
    And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the past conference calls about opening up its 
vehicle charging network.
    Can you speak to some of the feedback you&#x27;ve been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners?
    And how the ramp of the charging network may progress from here?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?

    So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary
storage.
    If you just look at the -- what&#x27;s needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more 
stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage.
    So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive.
    So that is in line with expectations.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on
guidance for margins, just have a single comment there.
    I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business.</span>
    Relative to total revenues of the company, it&#x27;s still fairly small.
    And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the 
small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there.
    But as this business grows and smooths out, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re that far away from it.
    I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we&#x27;ll start doing
and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year.
    I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let&#x27;s go to the battery question.

    A steam engine is an external combustion engine vehicle.
    And there&#x27;s still a few around.
    They&#x27;re kind of quirky and kind of cool collectors&#x27; items.
    That&#x27;s how gasoline cars will be in the future.

    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
    Can you talk a little bit about how much of the actual cost structure is variable on these vehicles?
    And if you could give us a range on pulse or minus the lithium cost within those contracted volumes that you&#x27;re 
seeing?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think -- again, we&#x27;d really love to have a crystal ball here, but we don&#x27;t have it.

    So most cost is variable.
