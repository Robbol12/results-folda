leverage improvement?

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span class="r2">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on </span>
<span class="r4">the revenue model?</span>
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span class="r2">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span class="r2">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span class="r2">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span class="r2">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by </span>
<span class="r4">regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</span>

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.
    The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.

Two questions from me as well.
    First, following up on the autonomy.
    So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD 
incrementally.
    What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would 
trigger much higher take rates?
