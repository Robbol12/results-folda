[TSLA_Q2_2024] Between 2023 and 2024, did Tesla meet its guidance for year-over-year revenue growth and operating leverage improvement?

1. [Sentence #413] [UNCERTAIN]
     In the years come it'll be over 10 million, then over 20 million.
     This is immense scale.
     And the car is able to operate 24/7, unlike the human driver.
     So, the capability to -- like, if there's this basically instant scale with a software update.
     And now this is for a customer on fleet.
     So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet, or cancel that and bring it back.
     It can be used by the fleet all the time.
>>> It can be used by the fleet some of the time, and then Tesla would take -- would share on the revenue with the customer.
     But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on wheels.
     The -- I mean, then in addition we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet.
     I guess that would be a bit more like Uber.
     But this would all be a Tesla network.
     And there's an important clause we've put in, in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet.
     They cannot be used by a third-party for autonomy.
