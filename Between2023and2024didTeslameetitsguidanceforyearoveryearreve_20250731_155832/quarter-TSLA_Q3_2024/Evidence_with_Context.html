leverage improvement?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">150</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Level <span class="r2">2</span> would be using all the power of the sun, and Level <span class="r2">3</span>, all of power of the galaxy, so we&#x27;ve got a long way to
go, long way to go.
    When you think of courtship terms, it becomes obvious that by far, the biggest source of energy is the sun.
    Everything else is in the.
    So, in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI.
    And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends.
    We think what we&#x27;re doing is the right approach.
    And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company 
in the world and probably by a long shot.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we&#x27;re looking </span>
<span class="r4">forward to building an incredibly exciting future.</span>
    Thank you.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon.
    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
    Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with 
generation of record operating cash flows of $<span class="r2">6.3</span> billion.
    Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
