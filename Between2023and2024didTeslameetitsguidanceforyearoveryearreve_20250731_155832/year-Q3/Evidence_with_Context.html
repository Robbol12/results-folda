improvement?

    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r2">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r4">2.3</span><span class="r4"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4">, representing </span><span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4">% growth </span>
<span class="r4">versus </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r2">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r2">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.

    I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.

Thank you.

    Level <span class="r2">2</span> would be using all the power of the sun, and Level <span class="r2">3</span>, all of power of the galaxy, so we&#x27;ve got a long way to
go, long way to go.
    When you think of courtship terms, it becomes obvious that by far, the biggest source of energy is the sun.
    Everything else is in the.
    So, in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics and AI.
    And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends.
    We think what we&#x27;re doing is the right approach.
    And if we execute on our objectives, I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company 
in the world and probably by a long shot.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we&#x27;re looking </span>
<span class="r4">forward to building an incredibly exciting future.</span>
    Thank you.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon.
    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
    Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with 
generation of record operating cash flows of $<span class="r2">6.3</span> billion.
    Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span class="r2">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company</span>
<span class="r4">in the world by far.</span>
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r2">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
