<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">53</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So let&#x27;s see.
    On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to <span class="r2">391</span> miles for Model S 
and <span class="r2">351</span> miles for Model X.
    Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is <span class="r2">400</span> miles, but when we did the last EPA 
test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span class="r2">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span class="r2">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r2">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r2">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.</span>
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.

    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.</span>
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
