    So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
    Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
    So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span class="r2">1</span> million units in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span class="r2">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span class="r2">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
    And we remain confident of exceeding <span class="r2">50</span>% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next 
years, I mean, so yes.
    And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the 
Optimus robot program.
    The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
