    But this journey is not over.
    We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we
are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span class="r2">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
    Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.</span>
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
    So basically, there is a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year.
    And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times.
    Super appreciate it.
