    So we don&#x27;t view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
    I just think it&#x27;s a process, and we&#x27;ve been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
    So again, that&#x27;s all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
    I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
    Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
    I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?</span>
    Or are there other opportunities?
    And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get 
color on?
    James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn&#x27;t specific just to Comanche Peak.
    As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced
activities.
    We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we&#x27;re working across the fleet on front of the 
meter and co-located deals.
    I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options 
they&#x27;re evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
    So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by 
year-end.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It&#x27;s an important topic.
    Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
    I think that&#x27;s been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
    And it&#x27;s important that we&#x27;ve been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data 
center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
    So in my view, you&#x27;re not done until you&#x27;re done.
    And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
    And so it isn&#x27;t just about price, it&#x27;s also about terms.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So given that background, there&#x27;s been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.</span>
    And while I&#x27;m not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about 
where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
    I hope that&#x27;s helpful color, David.
    I know there&#x27;s going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
    The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
    David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
    I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.

    Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
    I appreciate that.
    And then maybe on the M&amp;A front, I know you have something pending right now.
    Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
    And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
    James A. Burke

It&#x27;s a good question, Michael.
    We don&#x27;t see it as precluding.

    As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
    As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation 
types within our fleet.
    We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these 
projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
    In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value 
creation.

    With that, operator, we&#x27;re ready to open the line for questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

<span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> And our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
    Please go ahead with your question.
    Shahriar Pourreza

Hey guys, good morning.
    Jim Burke

Hey, Shar, good morning.
    Shahriar Pourreza

Good morning, Jim.
    Jim, I couldn&#x27;t get a sense on the preparations .
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just on Comanche Peak, deal conversations, are you waiting specifically for co-locations at this point or could you </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">be moving ahead with front of the meter and virtual PPAs in the interim?</span>
    And the reason why I ask is one of your peers noted yesterday that FOM and BTM pricing is harmonizing in their 
customer conversations, which I think is counter to what Vistra has been messaging in the past.
    So just a little bit of a sense there, thanks.
    Jim Burke

Sure.
    Well, Shar, I think what I&#x27;ve tried to mention on previous calls, and I know we&#x27;ve covered a lot of ground, really, 
for the past year&#x27;s worth of calls, that no two deals really are going to look alike.
    I think the customer needs really dictate that.
    And for some areas of the country, the front of the meter may actually be as good of an opportunity set as 
co-location.
    From our perspective, when we&#x27;ve looked at the deals that we&#x27;re working on with many customers, they&#x27;re still 
looking at co-location as a potential speed advantage.

    That&#x27;s actually very consistent in the past.
    And then, Jim, just lastly, I know this is not an easy question to answer, but just on general deal timeline at this
point, does SB6 finalization, does that unlock a Comanche deal?
    Jim Burke

I think SB6, the end result of SB6 will unlock a lot of things.
    We don&#x27;t know how SB6 is going to frankly turn out.
    I mean, there&#x27;s a hearing today.
    It&#x27;s the first time it&#x27;s being picked up in the House.
    And as we&#x27;ve covered in previous calls, Texas could attract a lot of load if we&#x27;re able to lay out clear rules and 
regulations.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think that could unlock a Comanche Peak deal, but I think it could unlock a lot of deals, including front of </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">the meter deals.</span>
    SB6 deals with both.
    And so we&#x27;re active on SB6 as are our peers, as is the large customer coalition is very active on this.
    So the session ends in early June.
    The goal obviously would be to get clarity around that time frame and I would expect that you will see some things 
announced shortly thereafter with the view that the deal parameters and the kinds of things that folks are trying to 
contract around would become more clear.
    Shahriar Pourreza

Got it.
    Perfect.
    Thanks again, Jim.
