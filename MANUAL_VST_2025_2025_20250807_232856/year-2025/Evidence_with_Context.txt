[Year 2025] Comanche Peak

1. [Sentence #683, VST_Q2_2025_transcript] [PLAN]
     So we don't view that as a gating item necessarily, David.
     I just think it's a process, and we've been very interactive with stakeholders in Austin throughout our discussion.
     So again, that's all part of when I say I feel good about where we are in getting a deal done.
     I say it with respect to that, and I also say it with respect to timing.
     Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Sorry, just one more on the timing front.
     I think you said kind of more updates by year-end.
>>> Is that specifically referring to Comanche Peak?
     Or are there other opportunities?
     And any color you want to provide on maybe some of the other things that might be in the hopper that we could get color on?
     James A. Burke

Yes, Michael, that wasn't specific just to Comanche Peak.
     As I mentioned earlier in the background on responding about the Comanche Peak opportunity, we have not preannounced activities.
     We will talk to you about the level of activity and the fact that we're working across the fleet on front of the meter and co-located deals.
     I could see because you manage a queue, customer interest comes and goes at times depending on what other options they're evaluating even beyond our portfolio of opportunities.
     So we think that there could be other opportunities that could come from where they sit today to completion by year-end.

2. [Sentence #654, VST_Q2_2025_transcript] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's an important topic.
     Our strategy to date has been to announce something when we have a completed agreement and not before.
     I think that's been a bit differentiating from others through this process.
     And it's important that we've been intentional in not providing a specific time frame because reaching any data center deal is complex, and we actually want to maintain leverage too in the negotiation of these deals.
     So in my view, you're not done until you're done.
     And our focus has been on finalizing the right deal for our company, which, of course, includes our shareholders.
     And so it isn't just about price, it's also about terms.
>>> So given that background, there's been a ton of interest in Comanche Peak.
     And while I'm not ready to preannounce anything, I can share with you that at this point, I feel very good about where things stand in getting a deal done at Comanche Peak.
     I hope that's helpful color, David.
     I know there's going to be other questions about it, but I feel really good about it.
     The team feels really good about it and something that the team is working hard at.
     David Keith Arcaro

Got it.
     I can appreciate that, and that is helpful color there.
     And maybe just to add one more question on that topic.

>>> But no, the year-end comment was not specific to Comanche Peak.
     Michael P. Sullivan

Okay.
     I appreciate that.
     And then maybe on the M&A front, I know you have something pending right now.
     Do you think about that as precluding you at all from doing any other deals in the interim?
     And any market power issues that you see in any grids that you might be running up against for any future deals?
     James A. Burke

It's a good question, Michael.
     We don't see it as precluding.

     As always, this remains subject to change with any new offtake agreements.
     As Jim outlined earlier, we see an exciting and expanding opportunity set of growth projects across all generation types within our fleet.
     We remain committed to our disciplined approach, including targeting at least mid-teens levered returns on these projects, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders and limiting the impact on our leverage metrics.
     In summary, the team remains focused on delivering another strong year and positioning Vistra for long-term value creation.
     As always, the team remains laser-focused on executing against our 4 strategic priorities in this growing demand backdrop.
     With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
>>> David Keith Arcaro

First, I thought could we start on Comanche Peak.
     I was wondering if you could just comment on how is the potential deal at Comanche Peak progressing and latest thoughts on timing there and any gating factors as you look at that opportunity?
     James A. Burke

David, I somehow knew this one was coming.
     So I appreciate you asking it.

     With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.
     Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.
     Please go ahead with your question.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Hey guys, good morning.
     Jim Burke

Hey, Shar, good morning.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Good morning, Jim.
     Jim, I couldn't get a sense on the preparations [ph].
>>> Just on Comanche Peak, deal conversations, are you waiting specifically for co-locations at this point or could you be moving ahead with front of the meter and virtual PPAs in the interim?
     And the reason why I ask is one of your peers noted yesterday that FOM and BTM pricing is harmonizing in their customer conversations, which I think is counter to what Vistra has been messaging in the past.
     So just a little bit of a sense there, thanks.
     Jim Burke

Sure.
     Well, Shar, I think what I've tried to mention on previous calls, and I know we've covered a lot of ground, really, for the past year's worth of calls, that no two deals really are going to look alike.
     I think the customer needs really dictate that.
     And for some areas of the country, the front of the meter may actually be as good of an opportunity set as co-location.
     From our perspective, when we've looked at the deals that we're working on with many customers, they're still looking at co-location as a potential speed advantage.
-----
10. [Sentence #167, VST_Q1_2025_transcript] [PLAN]
     That's actually very consistent in the past.
     And then, Jim, just lastly, I know this is not an easy question to answer, but just on general deal timeline at this point, does SB6 finalization, does that unlock a Comanche deal?
     Jim Burke

I think SB6, the end result of SB6 will unlock a lot of things.
     We don't know how SB6 is going to frankly turn out.
     I mean, there's a hearing today.
     It's the first time it's being picked up in the House.
     And as we've covered in previous calls, Texas could attract a lot of load if we're able to lay out clear rules and regulations.
>>> And I think that could unlock a Comanche Peak deal, but I think it could unlock a lot of deals, including front of the meter deals.
     SB6 deals with both.
     And so we're active on SB6 as are our peers, as is the large customer coalition is very active on this.
     So the session ends in early June.
     The goal obviously would be to get clarity around that time frame and I would expect that you will see some things announced shortly thereafter with the view that the deal parameters and the kinds of things that folks are trying to contract around would become more clear.
     Shahriar Pourreza

Got it.
     Perfect.
     Thanks again, Jim.
