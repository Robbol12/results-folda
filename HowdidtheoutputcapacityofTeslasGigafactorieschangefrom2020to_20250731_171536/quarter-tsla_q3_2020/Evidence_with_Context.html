    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2024</span>, and did it match the 
capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

    Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
    Yes.
    If it goes well, we&#x27;ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next -- towards the end of next 
year, yes.
    So it&#x27;s difficult to predict.
    I would say there&#x27;s probably a lot of deliveries in <span class="r2">2022</span>, and some deliveries towards the end of next year, if 
things go well.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And now I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it&#x27;s going to be almost </span><span class="r4">850</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> units on an </span>
<span class="r4">annualized basis.</span>
    And you&#x27;re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.
    You say today you would open Austin as well.
    So you&#x27;re probably going to end the year above <span class="r2">1</span> million units.
    And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver like somewhere like between <span class="r2">840</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and <span class="r2">1</span> million 
cars during the year?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    We&#x27;ll<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Drew.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, we&#x27;ll provide guidance on <span class="r2">2021</span> after next earnings call.

    So it’s overall going well.
    I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next 
year.
    But because of the exponential nature of the spool up of manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it
will start off very slow at first and then become very -- afterward will become very large.
    Just in general, manufacturing follows the S-curve and I think, some of those people kind of spend a lot of time 
manufacturing kind of things that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on and it&#x27;s at capacity.
    But it will typically take about <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months to reach capacity.
    And that is a very fast period of time, especially for new technology.
    So yes, I&#x27;d say, <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">24</span> months even.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time.</span>
    Then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an s-curve.
    It goes exponential to linear to logarithmic.
    And it&#x27;s actually incredibly hard thing, just bringing a production plant up to volume technology.
    If you can actually think of it like you&#x27;ve got to first order approximation, <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> unique parts of processes, all 
of which operate on an s-curve and with a bunch of uncertainty, and you can just slide <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> s-curves on an x-axis, and
that&#x27;s what bringing up a large automotive plant is like.
    And which one is the laggard, which one is the leader, it&#x27;s very difficult to tell, and it&#x27;s constantly changing.
    So it&#x27;s really one of the most difficult challenges I&#x27;ve ever seen.
    So let&#x27;s see.
