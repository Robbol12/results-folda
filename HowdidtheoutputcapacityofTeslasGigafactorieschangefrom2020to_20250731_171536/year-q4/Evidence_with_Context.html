    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[Year Q4]</span> How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2024</span>, and did it match the capacity 
projections shared in earnings calls?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">830</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    But our internal goal here by the end of the year is to be in enough locations that <span class="r2">80</span>% of our customers within the 
U.S. could choose to sign up for Tesla Insurance if they wanted to.
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around that based upon the regulatory processes, but that&#x27;s our goal.
    And then, as we make more progress rolling out in the states and each incremental state becomes a little bit less 
effort than the prior, that&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll turn our attention to the Europe market.
    We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
    We&#x27;ll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin
and Austin?
    And timing for new factory announcements?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">I don&#x27;t think we want to comment on -- like that&#x27;s -- it&#x27;s always possible to increase the output of any given factory, </span>
<span class="r4">to say, what&#x27;s the next capacity?</span>
    Well, it&#x27;s difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity 
quite a lot.
    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span class="r2">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">602</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    This is a critical milestone for the Company.
    So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
    So, we&#x27;ve begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
    But that&#x27;s not the most important thing.
    We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
    But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we&#x27;ve been making quite a few cars in 
Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
    So, in Texas, we&#x27;re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the <span class="r2">4680</span> cells, and we’ll start 
delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new </span>
<span class="r4">locations in the future.</span>
    Although we&#x27;re not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through <span class="r2">2022</span>, look at new locations
and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
    In <span class="r2">2022</span>, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
    So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
    And yes, so that&#x27;s -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
    And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I&#x27;m not sure what you do
for an encore to <span class="r2">2021</span>, <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in <span class="r2">2022</span> over <span class="r2">2021</span>, comfortably above <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    Full Self-Driving.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">621</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, it&#x27;s -- the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving by a software update, I think, might end up 
being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history.
    We shall see.
    It would also have a profound impact on improving safety and on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy 
through vastly better asset utilization.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    So, on the product road map front, there&#x27;s quite a lot to talk about.
    I&#x27;m not going to go through every sort of thing that we&#x27;re working on because I think a lot of them deserve product 
launches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call.
    So, I&#x27;ll talk kind of at a high level -- yes, mostly at a high level.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.</span>
    So, both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
    This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
    So, last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, 
changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
    And that was not the only supply chain issue.
    So there&#x27;s just hundreds of things.
    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span class="r2">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And we hopefully that is later this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?</span>
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span class="r2">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span class="r2">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1128</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding batteries, production rate of </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cells reached </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re </span>
<span class="r4">increasing capacity for </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cells by another </span><span class="r4">100</span><span class="r4"> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.</span>
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
    So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
    And we&#x27;ve got an amazing plan for making the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell low-cost and high energy density.
    So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">289</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So we definitely need to make it work well in China.
    I think some of it works well in China, then we will have a Grade <span class="r2">4</span> FSD.
    I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
    Their attention to detail is incredible.
    So they -- I&#x27;m confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
    And we hopefully that is later this year.

    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of </span>
<span class="r4">Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue </span>
<span class="r4">probably one level.</span>
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span class="r2">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.

    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around that based upon the regulatory processes, but that&#x27;s our goal.
    And then, as we make more progress rolling out in the states and each incremental state becomes a little bit less 
effort than the prior, that&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll turn our attention to the Europe market.
    We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
    We&#x27;ll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

    So, it is a whole thing in and of itself.
    And this is something which we offer potentially as a service.
    So, some of the others need neural net training, we&#x27;re not trying to keep it to ourselves.
    So, I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
    And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from <span class="r2">100</span>% to <span class="r2">200</span>% better than 
average human to <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% better than average human.
    So, that will be very helpful in that regard.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is what is Tesla&#x27;s current gigawatt-hour run rate of the </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell production?</span>
    How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-<span class="r2">2021</span> or end of <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

I think we kind of talked about that true.
    I mean essentially, what we&#x27;re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we&#x27;ve got a <span class="r2">100</span> 
gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    It&#x27;s not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
    But we are installing capacity for -- in <span class="r2">2022</span> for <span class="r2">200</span> gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able 
to achieve <span class="r2">30</span>% of targeted design capacity in <span class="r2">2022</span>.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Yes.
    Agreed, Elon.
    And as you&#x27;ve said before, with the S curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S 
curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next.
    So, yes, I mean we are progressing up that S curve as fast as we possibly can.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we don&#x27;t see any showstoppers.
