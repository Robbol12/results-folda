[TSLA_Q4_2020] How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from 2020 to 2024, and did it match the capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #195]  The next question is what is Tesla's current gigawatt-hour run rate of the 4680 cell production?
2. [Sentence #200]  But we are installing **capacity** for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design **capacity** in 2022.
3. [Sentence #289]  And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term **earnings** power is tied to profit per unit of battery **capacity**?
4. [Sentence #294]  What's the **output** of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
5. [Sentence #312]  And so we -- since the cell **output** drives vehicle **output**, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell **output** that implies vehicle **output**, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
