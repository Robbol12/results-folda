capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

Thank you.
    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?</span>
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span class="r2">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span class="r2">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.

    So we definitely need to make it work well in China.
    I think some of it works well in China, then we will have a Grade <span class="r2">4</span> FSD.
    I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
    Their attention to detail is incredible.
    So they -- I&#x27;m confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
    And we hopefully that is later this year.

    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of </span>
<span class="r5">Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue </span>
<span class="r5">probably one level.</span>
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span class="r2">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.

    So, it is a whole thing in and of itself.
    And this is something which we offer potentially as a service.
    So, some of the others need neural net training, we&#x27;re not trying to keep it to ourselves.
    So, I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
    And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from <span class="r2">100</span>% to <span class="r2">200</span>% better than 
average human to <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% better than average human.
    So, that will be very helpful in that regard.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is what is Tesla&#x27;s current gigawatt-hour run rate of the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cell production?</span>
    How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-<span class="r2">2021</span> or end of <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

I think we kind of talked about that true.
    I mean essentially, what we&#x27;re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we&#x27;ve got a <span class="r2">100</span> 
gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    It&#x27;s not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
    But we are installing capacity for -- in <span class="r2">2022</span> for <span class="r2">200</span> gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able 
to achieve <span class="r2">30</span>% of targeted design capacity in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Yes.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Yes.
    Agreed, Elon.
    And as you&#x27;ve said before, with the S curve of production, you can be off a little bit on the initial part of the S 
curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite a bit, one month to the next.
    So, yes, I mean we are progressing up that S curve as fast as we possibly can.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we don&#x27;t see any showstoppers.
