capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

Yes.
    And there’s like two general classes of cell.
    There&#x27;s like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer 
range.
    Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack 
you have to subtract in cargo.
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
    What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive 
coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total 
vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model <span class="r2">3</span>, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron 
phosphate battery pack in Model <span class="r2">3</span> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy </span>
<span class="r5">density.</span>
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.

Thank you.
    The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard <span class="r2">3</span> Range version of Model Y.
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
