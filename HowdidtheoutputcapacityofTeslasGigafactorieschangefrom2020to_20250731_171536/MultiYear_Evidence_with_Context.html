    We see demand is good.
    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week.
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?</span>
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.

    But I believe as everything I&#x27;ve ever said would come true – did come true, it may come through late, but it did 
come true.
    So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end.
    So – and I think we could see robo-taxi fleet in operation with the network fleet next year.

Our last question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Please go ahead.</span>
    Pierre Ferragu

Hey, thanks for taking my question.
    One on gross margin, first.
    I know your impressive performance in Q1.
    So there are three moving parts, the tailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y is ramping.
    Even if it broke even, it probably took average gross margin down.
    And of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the last week of the quarter.
    It probably was the sort of an extra cost.

    Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
    Please go ahead.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening.
    Question on Model Y. I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how the gross margin is 
already positive at such low volume.
    How much of it is a function of the commonality with the Model <span class="r2">3</span>, what other factors should we think about?
    And what does that mean for the app flow for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?
    Elon Musk

Zach?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">Sure.</span>
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.</span>
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
    Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
    So it was lower than the overall average, and that will increase with time.
    And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont also weighed on margin.
    And the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.
    Even though it&#x27;s increasing quickly and approaching Model <span class="r2">3</span>, it still is below the average.
    And so I think the sentiment of your question was, if you were to remove those factors, was there a sequential 
increase in gross margin.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition is right.</span>
    We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned.
    And in particular, S and X gross margins continue to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed 
cost amortization.
    So there&#x27;s good progress happening, both on the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for our products and 
production.
    And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross profit contribution to the company once we get through 
these inefficiencies, we get them on up and running again, we increase capacity so we can spread out fixed costs and 
continue to execute on cost reductions on our products, we feel very optimistic about that path going forward.
    Pierre Ferragu

Thanks.
    And I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well.
    I think like – I can&#x27;t remember – I think from the very first days I heard you on the call, you&#x27;ve always mentioned 
that demand for energy storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you can make.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite 
most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
    What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
    For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
    Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
    I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the 
future.
    And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
    In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">Agree.</span>
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.

    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash </span>
<span class="r4">flows.</span>
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.

    It’s the reason I say it&#x27;s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is 
training Google all the time with their searches.
    So, when you&#x27;re searching something and you click on a link, you&#x27;re training Google every time you do that.
    It&#x27;s very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
    So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be able to drive through an intersection
without a confirmation as well as to make turns.
    And we really feel we&#x27;re -- I feel extremely confident that it would be possible to do a drive from your home to 
your office most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year.
    So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading-edge Alpha  driving the car.
    So let&#x27;s see.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to </span><span class="r4">391</span><span class="r4"> miles for Model S </span>
<span class="r4">and </span><span class="r4">351</span><span class="r4"> miles for Model X.</span>
    Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is <span class="r2">400</span> miles, but when we did the last EPA 
test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span class="r2">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span class="r2">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r2">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r2">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.

for the world, and we want to do that as fast as possible.

    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone

    Now after that functionality is released, there&#x27;s still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, 
once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.
    And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
    And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.
    And then presumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous 
cars that can drive with no human onboard.
    Obviously, the regulatory approval process that&#x27;s difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because it&#x27;s out of our
hands.
    But for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.

So, to summarize, we want -- we&#x27;re going to give owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then a human is in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year?</span>
    Would that be the hope?

With a person -- initially a person who observes, would that be with the Tesla Network app, would that be really part of

    Is that the hope?

    It&#x27;s really quite sad that U.S. infrastructure especially it’s roads and highways is where it is today.
    And our airports, in a lot of cases, are an embarrassment.
    So -- and it&#x27;s not just a question of money.
    It&#x27;s a question of will.
    Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it?
    So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation
of the past.
    If this was <span class="r2">1920</span>, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously that’s not steam engines.</span>
    So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people&#x27;s rights, as what
is happening right now.
    I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if 
somebody wants to stay in their house, that&#x27;s great.
    They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
    But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
    This is not democratic.
    This is not freedom.

    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our vehicle inventory balance increased by </span><span class="r4">14</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in</span>
<span class="r4">Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.</span>
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.

    It&#x27;s a big problem.
    Different conversations.
    Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
    Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
    I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s a fair question.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t have any additional color to provide.</span>
    So $<span class="r2">8.1</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we&#x27;re managing it very closely.
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver
at the end of Q1.
    So we&#x27;re making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
    And as we&#x27;ve been looking at liquidity, we&#x27;ve been looking at this over the next <span class="r2">18</span> months, and there&#x27;s ups and 
downs to the liquidity.
    Currently now, as we&#x27;re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we&#x27;re paying off.
    But then in a couple of months, we&#x27;ll quickly be through that, and then we&#x27;ll have a gap in payables since we don&#x27;t 
have any parts coming in.
    So it does go up and down a little bit.

    Production is good.
    So it&#x27;s really all about the install, and then like also build out the training, the very diverse group of companies
in the roofing industry to also install Solar Roof that, I think will scale – allow us to scale far beyond <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week.
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?</span>
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span class="r2">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span class="r2">16</span> or <span class="r2">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.

    That&#x27;s associated with features that will be released with time.
    Our deferred revenue balance is continuing to grow.
    It&#x27;s a little bit over $<span class="r2">600</span> million.
    And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been 
released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
    And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
    So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">Absolutely.</span>
    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r2">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">20</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">55</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r2">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r2">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.</span>
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.

    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r2">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
    Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to <span class="r2">10</span> years?
    This would be <span class="r2">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span> and more than <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r2">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.

    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r2">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s possible that is </span><span class="r4">40</span><span class="r4">%.</span>
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span class="r2">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors.
    When will you announce the next Giga?
    How many Gigas, do you have planned for the next five years?
    Elon Musk

I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
    We may not – as soon as next month.

    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early </span>
<span class="r4">February.</span>
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">24</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">389</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how </span>
<span class="r4">we can make it lighter and simpler.</span>
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
    But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> once we have 
reached say, <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> or <span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units or something like that and…<span class="r8">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r8">]</span>.
    Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, your conference will resume momentarily.
    Thank you.
    Speakers, you&#x27;re back online.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So there are three moving parts, the tailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y is ramping.
    Even if it broke even, it probably took average gross margin down.
    And of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the last week of the quarter.
    It probably was the sort of an extra cost.
    And so when I looked at how gross margin evolved sequentially, excluding these three moving parts, I felt like your 
auto gross margin could have been up like a couple of points sequentially.
    So I wanted to check with you, if that estimate would make sense.
    And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sequential market improvement – margin improvement.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So the three things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full question here because 
we&#x27;re having a bit of network difficulty in the room.
    I&#x27;ll do my best here.
    So when we look at margin, we just look at credits as you have, so I agree with that.
    Model Y ramping, bringing down overall gross margin, I agree with that as well.
