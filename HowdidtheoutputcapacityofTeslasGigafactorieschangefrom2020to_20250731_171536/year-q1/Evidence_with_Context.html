Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
    You had to retrofit that to your need.
    So maybe you can give us a sense of how your new capacity is going to differ versus Fremont.
    What are the areas that you have efficiencies that you previously didn’t have and maybe how much does that add up to
improved COGS over time to help you achieve that $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicle?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We always talk too much about future product development.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Earnings calls are not the right place for us to make a major product announcement, so yes.</span>
    We will get there.
    We will provide it later.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    Unfortunately, this is all the time we have for today.
    Thank you very much for dialing in and for listening, and we will speak to you again in about three months.
    Thank you.

Hi, guys.
    Thanks so much for taking my question.
    I’d love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day.
    In the last six, seven months, I was wondering how much progress you have made on that front, first in terms of 
process development.
    So how are things coming together on your pilot line?
    Are you getting to the kind of production throughput you are aiming for?
    And second, actually on your production ramp.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I was wondering in which size you are ramping production capacity for the </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell and where you stand on </span>
<span class="r4">ramping up that capacity as well?</span>
    And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that’s possible.
    Elon Musk

Well, so we have the – and Drew can add to this.
    But we have the - a small sort of pilot plant, which is still big by normal standards.
    We expect to have like a <span class="r2">10</span>-gigawatt-hour per year capability in Fremont, California.
    And we made quite a few cells.
    We are not quite yet at the point where we think the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we are 
getting close to that point.
    And then we have already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much of it for 
Austin as well.

    But Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the 
Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy a Tesla 
vehicles in the future.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    As Elon has said and as we’ve publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-party vehicle access in all over 
the world, not just in Europe, where our original pilot was.
    And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being 
different than others, but we are moving in that direction.
    I don’t know if you want to add.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think that’s -- there’s nothing more to be said on that, but we’re -- yes, we want to do the right thing with 
respect to the whole system.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger </span>
<span class="r4">capacity is really important.</span>
    And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    Mark Delaney

Okay.
    That’s helpful.
    And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out 
in more states.
    Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?
    And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
