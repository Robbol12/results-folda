[TSLA_Q1_2022] How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from 2020 to 2024, and did it match the capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

1. [Sentence #501] [PILOT]
     But Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy a Tesla vehicles in the future.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     As Elon has said and as we’ve publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-party vehicle access in all over the world, not just in Europe, where our original pilot was.
     And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being different than others, but we are moving in that direction.
     I don’t know if you want to add.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think that’s -- there’s nothing more to be said on that, but we’re -- yes, we want to do the right thing with respect to the whole system.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
>>> With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger capacity is really important.
     And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     Mark Delaney

Okay.
     That’s helpful.
     And for my second question, could you share any more details on Tesla Insurance, in particular, as you roll it out in more states.
     Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like?
     And how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average?
