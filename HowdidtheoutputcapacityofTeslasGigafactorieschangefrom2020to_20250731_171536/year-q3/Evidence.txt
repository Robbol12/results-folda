[Year Q3] How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from 2020 to 2024, and did it match the capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #79]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) So generally, what I see is the manufacturing **capacity** is underestimated in the beginning for quite some time.
2. [Sentence #466]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) So if I look at your production **capacity** at the end of this year, it's going to be almost 850,000 units on an annualized basis.
3. [Sentence #738]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production **capacity** for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
4. [Sentence #1014]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And we'll continue to update on ****earnings** **calls**** as we learn more information.
5. [Sentence #1256]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) And several years ago, I said, I think on an **earnings** call, and I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market cap company, I think, in the market.
6. [Sentence #1410]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Total **output** is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter.
7. [Sentence #1857]  (TSLA_Q3_2023) Could you please provide an update on **capacity** expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
