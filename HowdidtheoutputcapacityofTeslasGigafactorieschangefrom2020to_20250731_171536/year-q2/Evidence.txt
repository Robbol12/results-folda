--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #350]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) And that frees up a lot of **capacity** for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density.
2. [Sentence #994]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) So I was wondering in which size you are ramping production **capacity** for the 4680 cell and where you stand on ramping up that **capacity** as well?
3. [Sentence #1119]  (TSLA_Q2_2021) ****Earnings** **calls**** are not the right place for us to make a major product announcement, so yes.
4. [Sentence #2379]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than ****earnings** **calls****.
5. [Sentence #2751]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Yes -- but I've said this before on ****earnings** **calls****, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy.
