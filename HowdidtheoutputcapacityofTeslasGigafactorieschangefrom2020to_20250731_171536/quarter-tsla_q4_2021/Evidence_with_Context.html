    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2024</span>, and did it match the 
capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">253</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    But our internal goal here by the end of the year is to be in enough locations that <span class="r2">80</span>% of our customers within the 
U.S. could choose to sign up for Tesla Insurance if they wanted to.
    There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty around that based upon the regulatory processes, but that&#x27;s our goal.
    And then, as we make more progress rolling out in the states and each incremental state becomes a little bit less 
effort than the prior, that&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll turn our attention to the Europe market.
    We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
    We&#x27;ll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

Thank you.
    Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin
and Austin?
    And timing for new factory announcements?

<span class="r4">I don&#x27;t think we want to comment on -- like that&#x27;s -- it&#x27;s always possible to increase the output of any given factory, </span>
<span class="r4">to say, what&#x27;s the next capacity?</span>
    Well, it&#x27;s difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity 
quite a lot.
    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span class="r2">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    This is a critical milestone for the Company.
    So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
    So, we&#x27;ve begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
    But that&#x27;s not the most important thing.
    We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
    But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we&#x27;ve been making quite a few cars in 
Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
    So, in Texas, we&#x27;re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the <span class="r2">4680</span> cells, and we’ll start 
delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new </span>
<span class="r4">locations in the future.</span>
    Although we&#x27;re not ready to announce any new locations on this call, but we will through <span class="r2">2022</span>, look at new locations
and probably be able to announce new locations towards the end of this year, I expect.
    In <span class="r2">2022</span>, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.
    So, the chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue.
    And yes, so that&#x27;s -- there are multiple supply chain challenges.
    And last year was difficult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth sailing, but I&#x27;m not sure what you do
for an encore to <span class="r2">2021</span>, <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Nonetheless, we do expect significant growth in <span class="r2">2022</span> over <span class="r2">2021</span>, comfortably above <span class="r2">50</span>% growth in <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    Full Self-Driving.

    So, it&#x27;s -- the cars in the fleet essentially becoming self-driving by a software update, I think, might end up 
being the biggest increase in asset value of any asset class in history.
    We shall see.
    It would also have a profound impact on improving safety and on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy 
through vastly better asset utilization.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    So, on the product road map front, there&#x27;s quite a lot to talk about.
    I&#x27;m not going to go through every sort of thing that we&#x27;re working on because I think a lot of them deserve product 
launches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call.
    So, I&#x27;ll talk kind of at a high level -- yes, mostly at a high level.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.</span>
    So, both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
    This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
    So, last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, 
changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
    And that was not the only supply chain issue.
    So there&#x27;s just hundreds of things.
    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span class="r2">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
