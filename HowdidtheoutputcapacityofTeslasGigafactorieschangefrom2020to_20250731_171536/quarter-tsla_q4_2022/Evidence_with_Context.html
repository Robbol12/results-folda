    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q4_2022]</span> How did the output capacity of Tesla’s Gigafactories change from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2024</span>, and did it match the 
capacity projections shared in earnings calls?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">41</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
    With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 
customers in North America.
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding batteries, production rate of </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells reached </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re </span>
<span class="r5">increasing capacity for </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> cells by another </span><span class="r5">100</span><span class="r5"> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.</span>
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
    Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time.
    So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.
    And we&#x27;ve got an amazing plan for making the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell low-cost and high energy density.
    So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate.
    That&#x27;s always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric 
vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind 
because obviously, the sun doesn&#x27;t shine all the time and the wind doesn&#x27;t blow all the time.
