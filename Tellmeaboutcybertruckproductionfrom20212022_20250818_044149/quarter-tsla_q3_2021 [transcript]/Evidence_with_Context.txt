[TSLA_Q3_2021 [Transcript]] Tell me about cybertruck production from 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #71] [PLAN]
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
     I think Zach spoke to that well.
     And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
     We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.
     While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
>>> As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
     And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
     Lars Moravy

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
     This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
     In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
     If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our ability to push out more updates.

2. [Sentence #240] [UNCERTAIN]
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn't happened and we know there are a lot of updates.
     Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
>>> We've been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
     As you may have seen recently on social media, we've built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to further mature the design.
     And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
     There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial vision.
     We'll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we're in now and look to launch that by next year.
     Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you very much.
     We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.

     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Very good quarter.
     I had two quick questions.
     First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
     Who are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
>>> And the second question is related to Cybertruck.
     Who is the supply looking at?
     If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I'll say in 23-24 time for Cybertruck?
     That's all for me.
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     Sure.
     So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.
     With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.

     So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
     And so, this already does exist.
     And not directly in the form here.
     And we don't call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in as a result.
     And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
     Martin Viecha

     That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.

7. [Sentence #114] [PLAN]
     We'll continue to ramp that factory.
     And in our plans, there with time are to keep growing the capacity in that factory.
     Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our first iterations of capacity there are on Model Y.
     But we've intentionally set these factories and locations in which they have a quite significant amount of land and ability to expand.
     And so, we'll take Model Y at these factories.
     We're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can.
     And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.
>>> And then we will add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there.
     So, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years.
     And then ultimately in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.
     We're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is, what is your view on the tightening regulatory environment for FSD in the investigation and broad data request by NHTSA?
     Some of the recent nominees to NHTSA have been publicly critical of FSD, including engaging with short-sellers online.

     With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look at multiple sources.
     We have made some early sourcing decisions in that but I think we'll keep that one internal and we've already began the first casting in of that.
     Rolling stainless isn't so different from rolling any other materials.

     Rolling stainless isn't so different from rolling any other materials.
     It's about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.
     And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with our suppliers and vendors to make sure those timelines and supply meet the need and demand of our customers.
     Andrew Baglino

And on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some.
     They're largely associated with the different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaboration with like local codes and other governing requirements that drives the differences in the architecture between the locations.

10. [Sentence #64] [PLAN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
     Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter.
     Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
     However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
     Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
     And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the pack timeline I just mentioned.
