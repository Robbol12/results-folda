[TSLA_Q3_2022 [Transcript]] Tell me about cybertruck production from 2021-2022

1. [Sentence #165] [PLAN]
     Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
     Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
     And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
     Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
     So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?
     What is the initial Phase 1 production target?
     When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
     We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
     We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
     Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
     That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
     Elon Musk

Great.

     Elon Musk

Before incentive.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
     So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
     Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
     And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
>>> And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023?
     And I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
     Yes.
     We are making Model Ys.
     Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680.
     And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?

3. [Sentence #69] [UNCERTAIN]
     In fact, I think it will be very difficult.
     It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.
     But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco.
     And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.
     I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.
     So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
     I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, some of which you haven’t.
>>> We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.
     We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.
     And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we’re moving at top speed to do that.
     So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
     None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
     So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team.
     You guys rock.
     You’re the ones making it happen.

     Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
     That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.

6. [Sentence #259] [UNCERTAIN]
     When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
     And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
     Elon Musk

Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously.
     At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
     So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
     It will be smaller, to be clear.
     But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
>>> I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.
     But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.
     So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.
     It’s like, we’re going to take two.
     That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Effort costs.
     Elon Musk

Yes…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.

     Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
     Once you get out of that…

Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold.
     When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
     And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
     Elon Musk
