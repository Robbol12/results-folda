    Let&#x27;s go to the next question, please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi.
    Thank you for taking my question.
    I just feel how you<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

Hi, Pierre.
    We cannot hear you.
    Martin Viecha

It&#x27;s very quiet, so we can&#x27;t hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me now?
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s muffled, but we&#x27;ll try.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Sorry for that.
    So, I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the deliveries of the previous quarter and that Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> has indeed </span>
<span class="r6">cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.</span>
    So how are you thinking about these two models going forward?
    What&#x27;s the strategy you have in mind?
    And I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.

Elon Musk

The Model S and X are really niche -- they&#x27;re really niche products.
    I mean, they&#x27;re very expensive, made in low volume.
    To be totally frank, we&#x27;re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else.
    They&#x27;re really of minor importance to the future.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    That makes sense.
    And then, my question<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

They&#x27;re great cars.
    The Model S I think if you want -- I mean, the Model S literally won Motor Trend&#x27;s best car ever in history by the 
way.
    I think if you&#x27;re out there and you&#x27;re buying -- and you&#x27;re going to buy a Model S, I think you just made a mistake,
to be totally frank.
    It&#x27;s incredible, especially the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for 
air purification, the raven powertrain.
    It&#x27;s the fastest car in the world, and it&#x27;s just so easy to drive.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">257</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    DeepScale is a very tiny company.
    It&#x27;s basically about <span class="r2">12</span> people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given
amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
    So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly 
accelerate FSD.
    That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
    Yeah.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The second question, we&#x27;ve already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
    So we&#x27;ll jump to the third question from Craig.
    News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.
    Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga <span class="r2">3</span>?
    And confirm purpose of the second building now being built.
    Is that for battery production as suggested by some press outlets?
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yeah, we&#x27;re in trial production of Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6">, basically sending cars through the system, and we&#x27;re ramping rapidly.</span>
    We&#x27;re expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.
    The second building is indeed for battery and module production.
    And there&#x27;s probably -- there&#x27;s obviously a bunch more construction beyond what is already there because obviously 
we need to build out more facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla car insurance?
    Is there a timeline to expand it nationally and internationally?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I can take that.
    So far, we&#x27;ve launched Tesla Insurance in California.
    I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased by the results so far.
    The take rates as measured by quote-to-purchase conversion are quite high by industry standards, and we expect that 
this will only increase as folks understand the products better and receive some of the known price increases coming 
from some of the standard carriers that they&#x27;ll come to us and look for an alternative.
    There&#x27;s a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly the purchase flow, to 
make sure it&#x27;s the best product experience for our customers.
    And we&#x27;re also working very hard to get other states lined up in the States, and then also to launch in some 
countries internationally.
    So we&#x27;re not able to provide specific timelines on those changes, but we&#x27;re definitely working as quickly as we can,
given how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">324</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We&#x27;ve also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our products and 
how we optimize that based on local supply and demand.
    And so, I think there is a bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.
    And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us.
    It&#x27;s hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company.
    And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there.
    So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics, there&#x27;s just a 
tremendous amount of good work that happened there.
    Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I&#x27;ll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable 
whether that&#x27;s considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue
associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that 
because we know there&#x27;s been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
    And foreign exchange is just something that since we don&#x27;t hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every 
quarter.
    So we&#x27;ll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
    This is George Dailey on for Adam.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> sold in</span>
<span class="r6">China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont </span>
<span class="r6">right now?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it&#x27;s a good question.
    At least based on the plans that we have now, we&#x27;re expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is coming 
out of our Fremont factory.
    There&#x27;s still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and 
we need to work those costs down.
    And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the 
product offering.
    So I think just for now, it&#x27;s safe to assume that it&#x27;s roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of 
the Fremont facility.
    George Dailey

Great.
    And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it&#x27;s been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many 
OEMs seem that they don&#x27;t have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don&#x27;t even offer 
one right now.
    As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with
batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of 
sustainable transport?
    Elon Musk

Yeah, I think there&#x27;s -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric 
vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
    So it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re open to.
    As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of
electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
    And we&#x27;re definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">105</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.
    We&#x27;ve also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.
    Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly.
    As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we&#x27;ve been able to pull 
in the timeline for other major projects.
    Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth and our financial health continues to 
strengthen.
    We remain focused on reducing cost which enables rapid investments in future programs and growth.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And I think also our Director of Energy Operations Kunal Girotra wanted to have some remarks.
    Kunal Girotra

Hi, everyone.
    My name is Kanal Girotra, and I&#x27;ve been with Tesla for about four years working on different aspects of deploying 
our energy products.
    I now run Tesla Energy&#x27;s deployment and fulfillment teams.
    Over the last three months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our Solar and Energy Storage 
businesses.
    As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost <span class="r2">50</span>% over last quarter, and our energy 
storage deployments, which include Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by <span class="r2">15</span>% to an all-time high of <span class="r2">477</span> megawatt hours.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into three </span>
<span class="r6">sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.</span>
    Elon Musk

Actually, if I may interject.
    What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is, in California and in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar 
subscription or solar rental, there&#x27;s no money down, and you instantly save on your utility bill, and there&#x27;s no 
long-term contract.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Right.
    Elon Musk

So, it&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.
    It&#x27;s really, do you want something that prints money?
    And if it doesn&#x27;t print money, we&#x27;ll fix it or take it back.
    It&#x27;s kind of a no-brainer.
    And it sort of plays into Tesla&#x27;s overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributor 
global utility<span class="r5">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Elon Musk

On the energy side.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, absolutely.
    The subscription solar offering that you mentioned has launched in six states, and like you said, it&#x27;s six monthly 
payments and no long-term contracts, and the response from customers has been pretty awesome so far.
    Elon Musk

Most people do actually buy it, as opposed to rent it, which actually is technically the better -- while you make money 
immediately if you rental, it&#x27;s actually a better investment if you buy it, because the cost of capital of the consumer 
is better than our cost of capital.
    And then, there&#x27;s an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other organizations that show that adding solar to 
your home increases the price -- increases the value of your home, and the Zillow study showed a <span class="r2">4</span>% increase in the 
value of the home with solar.

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">181</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Yeah, what we&#x27;re seeing is that word of mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of production.
    We have no plans to advertise at this time.
    At some point in the future, we may do advertising not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and 
make sure they are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from institutional investor is, Elon, other than robo-taxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, 
when you look over the next three years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don&#x27;t 
understand or have missed?
    Elon Musk

I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking 
about.
    In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla&#x27;s automotive sector or 
business.
    This is the most underappreciated group.
    I think it could be bigger, but it&#x27;s certainly of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar.
    Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.
    And part of it is like, for about <span class="r2">18</span> months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources.
    We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production -- 
fixing the Model <span class="r2">3</span> production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even 
took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we 
didn&#x27;t have enough cells.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that we feel that Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we&#x27;ve restored resources to</span>
<span class="r6">Tesla Solar and storage.</span>
    And so that&#x27;s going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine.
    And but we had to do it because if we didn&#x27;t solve Model <span class="r2">3</span>, Tesla wouldn&#x27;t survive.
    So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.
    But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part
of Tesla&#x27;s activity in the future.
    And Tesla&#x27;s mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means 
sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.
    And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much 
sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products.
    And I think you&#x27;ll see that we&#x27;re producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are 
consumed in the car -- in our cars.
    Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars is like, don&#x27;t they use dirty power from coal?
    Well, no, we&#x27;re solar power.
    Obviously the solar power came from companies, not just Tesla.
    Yeah, sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    And we&#x27;ll do more of it.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">253</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    So if you were to include that, which is obviously recognized as we release the full self-driving functionalities, 
the actual gross margin we&#x27;re operating in on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s now go to questions from retail investors.
    The first question from Craig is, can you provide more detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its importance, and 
whether Tesla is still on track to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city
streets by the end of <span class="r2">2019</span>?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    DeepScale is a very tiny company.
    It&#x27;s basically about <span class="r2">12</span> people, and they have some expertise in increasing the efficiency of neural nets for a given
amount of compute, which I think is helpful.
    So it remains to be seen, but the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition was to, I think, slightly 
accelerate FSD.
    That is the intent, and hopefully that will turn out to be true.
    Yeah.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The second question, we&#x27;ve already answered regarding Model Y delivery.
    So we&#x27;ll jump to the third question from Craig.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing Model 3s for Chinese market.</span>

Okay.
    Thank you.
    The next question from investor is related to full self-driving attach rates.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">455</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    It&#x27;s incredible, especially the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for 
air purification, the raven powertrain.
    It&#x27;s the fastest car in the world, and it&#x27;s just so easy to drive.
    It makes you feel like Superman driving that car.
    It&#x27;s incredibly safe.
    It&#x27;s just an amazing vehicle.
    And then, Model S, I think, is like Faberge egg of cars.
    I mean, not Model X.
    Model X is like the Faberge egg of cars.
    Yeah, that&#x27;s why so many artists and musicians buy the car.
    It&#x27;s an art piece basically.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, just to add -- I agree.
    They&#x27;re absolutely phenomenal cars.
    And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6">, that&#x27;s kind of </span>
<span class="r6">consumed a lot of the attention around the company.</span>
    But now as that has stabilized, we&#x27;re able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter.
    And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in 
Q4.
    Elon Musk

I mean, Model S -- basic Model S at this point has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    Actually, technically it&#x27;s <span class="r2">373</span>, but we actually certified it incorrectly as <span class="r2">370</span>, but it&#x27;s <span class="r2">373</span>.
    And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.
    I forgot to mention, we&#x27;re also expecting there&#x27;s going to be an over-the-air improvement that will improve the 
power of the Model S, X, and <span class="r2">3</span>.
    That&#x27;s, by the way coming in a few weeks.
    Should be in the order of <span class="r2">5</span>% power improvement due to improved firmware.
    Drew, do you want to say anything on that?
    Drew Baglino

Yeah, we just continue to learn how to optimize the motor control in our products.
    And yeah, so <span class="r2">5</span>% improvement for all Model <span class="r2">3</span> customers and <span class="r2">3</span>% for S and X.

Elon Musk

Yeah, and there&#x27;s also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.
    Drew Baglino

Very excited about that.

    And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.
    And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model <span class="r2">3</span>, that&#x27;s kind of 
consumed a lot of the attention around the company.
    But now as that has stabilized, we&#x27;re able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter.
    And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in 
Q4.
    Elon Musk

I mean, Model S -- basic Model S at this point has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    Actually, technically it&#x27;s <span class="r2">373</span>, but we actually certified it incorrectly as <span class="r2">370</span>, but it&#x27;s <span class="r2">373</span>.
    And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.
    I forgot to mention, we&#x27;re also expecting there&#x27;s going to be an over-the-air improvement that will improve the 
power of the Model S, X, and <span class="r2">3</span>.
    That&#x27;s, by the way coming in a few weeks.
    Should be in the order of <span class="r2">5</span>% power improvement due to improved firmware.
    Drew, do you want to say anything on that?
    Drew Baglino

Yeah, we just continue to learn how to optimize the motor control in our products.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And yeah, so </span><span class="r6">5</span><span class="r6">% improvement for all Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> customers and </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6">% for S and X.</span>

<span class="r6">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r6">Yeah, and there&#x27;s also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.</span>
    Drew Baglino

Very excited about that.
    It&#x27;s an improvement in comfort and feel.
    Elon Musk

Yeah, it&#x27;s easier to drive.
    And it improves the range.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    And faster super charging.
    Elon Musk

Faster super charging, yeah.
    Drew Baglino

For Standard Range and Standard Range Plus customers, which is a big deal.
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and it gets way better over time just through
the software.
    Not a little bit better, but a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s very exciting, I think.
    Yeah.
    As a customer myself, I enjoy these updates.

    And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us.
    It&#x27;s hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company.
    And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there.
    So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics, there&#x27;s just a 
tremendous amount of good work that happened there.
    Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I&#x27;ll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable 
whether that&#x27;s considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue
associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that 
because we know there&#x27;s been speculation around the impact for the quarter.
    And foreign exchange is just something that since we don&#x27;t hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every 
quarter.
    So we&#x27;ll have to see as the quarter plays out the effect that that has.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
    George Dailey

Hi, everyone.
    This is George Dailey on for Adam.
    So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> sold in
China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont 
right now?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

That one is also difficult to forecast, it&#x27;s a good question.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; At least based on the plans that we have now, we&#x27;re expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> is coming </span>
<span class="r6">out of our Fremont factory.</span>
    There&#x27;s still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and 
we need to work those costs down.
    And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the 
product offering.
    So I think just for now, it&#x27;s safe to assume that it&#x27;s roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of 
the Fremont facility.
    George Dailey

Great.
    And then, if I could just sneak in one more, so it&#x27;s been over seven years since you launched the Model S. And many 
OEMs seem that they don&#x27;t have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do, and many don&#x27;t even offer 
one right now.
    As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with
batteries or software or complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of 
sustainable transport?
    Elon Musk

Yeah, I think there&#x27;s -- it would be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with electric 
vehicles on the battery and powertrain front, possibly on other fronts.
    So it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re open to.
    As a lot of people know, we open sourced our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle to the adoption of
electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.
    And we&#x27;re definitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question, please.
