[TSLA_Q3_2019] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #105]  In the last three months, we relaunched Tesla Solar in ****North** **America**** by simplifying our solar offering into three sizes of small, medium and large with transfer and pricing on the website.
2. [Sentence #181]  Now that we feel that ****Model** 3** production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage.
3. [Sentence #183]  And but we had to do it because if we didn't solve ****Model** 3**, Tesla wouldn't survive.
4. [Sentence #253]  News reports suggest that Gigafactory may already be producing **Model** 3s for Chinese market.
5. [Sentence #257]  Elon Musk

Yeah, we're in trial production of ****Model** 3**, basically sending cars through the system, and we're **ramping** rapidly.
6. [Sentence #324]  So, first question, is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory is ramped, the ****Model** 3** sold in **China** for **China** could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?
7. [Sentence #326]  At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where ****Model** 3** is coming out of our Fremont factory.
8. [Sentence #430]  It looks like the **deliveries** have stayed to the **deliveries** of the previous quarter and that ****Model** 3** has indeed cannibalized the demand for these cars, quite a big deal.
9. [Sentence #455]  And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized ****Model** 3**, that's kind of consumed a lot of the attention around the company.
10. [Sentence #467]  And yeah, so 5% improvement for all ****Model** 3** customers and 3% for S and X.

Elon Musk

Yeah, and there's also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.
