America, Europe, and China?

    And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
    Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars <span class="r2">3</span> 
and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, </span>
<span class="r4">a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.</span>
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.
    Now that I think this may not be fully appreciated.

    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    Martin Viecha

According you see OpEx here to, but it&#x27;s not <span class="r2">2010</span>.
    Okay.
    The next question from institutional investors is given the recent run in the share price, why not raise capital now
and substantially accelerate the growth in production i.e.
    fill te Gigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service.
    Elon Musk

Well, we&#x27;re actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly.
    So if there&#x27;s any sensible way to spend money, we&#x27;re spending it.
    There is no artificial hold back on expenditures anything that I see that is what looks like a -- it&#x27;s got good 
value for money.
    The answer is yes immediately.
    So -- but we&#x27;re spending money I think efficiently and we&#x27;re not artificially limiting our progress.

    During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today&#x27;s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r6">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r6">]</span> But before we jump in the Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
    Deliveries reached over <span class="r2">112</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles in a single quarter.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $<span class="r2">20</span> billion in 
revenue with zero advertising spend.
    I think that&#x27;s like where we do say that from time-time and I think it&#x27;s often overlooked, but to have the highest 
demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of 
the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of 
advertising.
    At our Fremont factory we&#x27;re producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 
<span class="r2">2006</span> and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
    This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there&#x27;s lot of 
potential to go beyond that number.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the Shanghai factory I&#x27;d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> last </span>
<span class="r4">quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.</span>
    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span class="r2">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span class="r2">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span class="r2">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.
    For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went 
viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how 
such product should look.
    So it really just from the standpoint of what&#x27;s the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks 
the ass of any pickup truck, basically that&#x27;s the goal.
    And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand 
has been incredible.
    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">164</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investor analysts and what some of the smaller 
retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, they would -- you would probably get the highest accuracy and 
remarkable insight from some of those predictions.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    So now let&#x27;s switch to institutional shareholder questions.
    The number one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being <span class="r2">65</span>% lower CapEx per unit of 
capacity.
    Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective?
    And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
    Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in</span>
<span class="r4">China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that </span>

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">74</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent 
quarters.
    As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    This year for the Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
    In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the 
region.
    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
    We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model <span class="r2">3</span> and remain focused on continuing the production 
ramp and managing costs.
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
    For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which </span>
<span class="r4">I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.</span>
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
    At this point, we&#x27;re expecting a <span class="r2">1</span> to <span class="r2">1.5</span> week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span> due to a government 
required factory shutdown.
    This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
Shanghai remains in the early stages.
    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r2">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span class="r2">4</span> million new roofs per year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">65</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We&#x27;ve also seen a stabilization of Model <span class="r2">3</span> ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we&#x27;ve seen an increase in ASPs of
S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
    With respect to capacity expansion, we&#x27;ve greatly learned from the development and launch of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont and 
Reno.
    As a result, we&#x27;ve been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
    This is evidenced by the launch of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both 
launched in under one year.
    Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, 
improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and 
operational costs.
    And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled 
strong cash generation.
    We&#x27;ve also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and
the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
    Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $<span class="r2">82</span> million driven almost entirely by an expense 
related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
    This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied 
to.
    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent

    Coming out later this year end of the year, probably, that&#x27;s our goal, get Powertrain up end of the year and then 
it&#x27;s going to be like -- this is like alien technology, it&#x27;s insane.
    I think, I think we could do, yes, I mean I think there was no way, this could get engineering team, Tesla to a 
little about hardcore engineering.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Hi, good evening, everybody.
    So in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve, obviously you 
have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price.
    So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like steadily in <span class="r2">2020</span>?
    Elon Musk

Making the price better and better, so is the value.
    I know we&#x27;re wondering we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand looks like, I 
mean like right now it&#x27;s pretty good, maybe they will change who knows, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

But I think the way you described, it is fair.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I mean, relative to the current Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, China Model </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> pricing is slightly lower.</span>
    And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
    So you can see that it&#x27;s clearly slightly higher than what Model <span class="r2">3</span> is out of Fremont.
    How the mix of those three products and that&#x27;s out over the course of the year, we&#x27;ll see.
    I think it&#x27;s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP, when you 
average them together.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean the affordability of our car and trying to improve radically because for a very -- to tariffs mostly going 
to weigh, purchase tax exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the 
ocean.
    So the affordability is nine day for our car intent.

<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">303</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?
    Elon Musk

You know, we&#x27;re not quite sure what&#x27;s going to happen with, but it is true that Model X, the introduction of Model X 
actually increased Model S sales because you would come in, look at the Model X and they like said okay, I&#x27;d prefer the 
Sedan and we&#x27;re worried that X sales would of course S sales drop there -- actually could increase.
    So from us -- we&#x27;re not too worried about demand, we are worried about production, make sure we get that production 
ramp going and reach volume production as soon as possible with the Model Y.
    And it&#x27;s hard for -- it&#x27;s always to hard predict what -- the exponential part of the S curve of production.
    Production pretty much always follows those S-curve or it&#x27;s kind of like a herky-jerky S-curve.
    And you can use to predict what it&#x27;s going to be like in the beginning because it&#x27;s flow and it is pretty question 
like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S curve is very difficult to predict.
    So that&#x27;s and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
    So, I think we&#x27;re just going to have go as best we can with Model Y and make sure it&#x27;s a great product.
    I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- does on our October analyst call.
    And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of
the things they see.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it&#x27;s important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next <span class="r2">18</span> to <span class="r2">24</span> months.
    But what we&#x27;re working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have <span class="r2">3</span> and Y locally produced in all 
location.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">And so, Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of</span>
<span class="r4">having these products on the major continents.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Also the rule of thumb of <span class="r2">10</span>%, I think you need to see it when you see the car, you realize that it&#x27;s not just a <span class="r2">10</span>% 
different car.
    It&#x27;s not just that -- there is more change happening like to the customers&#x27; perspective as well.
    Unidentified Analyst

All right, thank guys.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much guys.
    Can you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reduction, as well as the mission to increase EV 
adoption.
    Is there a target for gross profit or operating profit on a per-vehicle basis that we should be thinking about or 
how should we really frame that for ourselves?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean we&#x27;re trying to make the cars as affordable as possible, as fast as possible, while maintaining reasonable 
-- while still being at least a little bit profitable and growing the company like crazy and having good free cash flow 
and accumulating our cash balance.
    Zach, anything you want to add?

<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">270</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the <span class="r2">10</span>-K, but back to the growth 
rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support 
that growth.
    So that helps.
    And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to 
continue to fund additional factory.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that 
Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.
    Operator

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it </span>
<span class="r4">does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating </span>
<span class="r4">production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> or Model Y cars.</span>
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.
    Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not 
announced for Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that 
project?
    Elon Musk

Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery capacity otherwise we add complexity, but 
we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
    So what we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the 
batteries to make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet.
    And it&#x27;s just generally true when I see some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, whether pointing 
out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the 
average number of occupants in a car, I think is like <span class="r2">1.2</span> and maybe with autonomy maybe it will go to <span class="r2">1.4</span> maybe, but I&#x27;m
not sure if that -- it even goes there.
    So, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or something like probably, 
but like I said we&#x27;re going to solve those battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people 
cannot even balance today, that&#x27;s the real problem.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.

    Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which 
I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
    At this point, we&#x27;re expecting a <span class="r2">1</span> to <span class="r2">1.5</span> week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span> due to a government 
required factory shutdown.
    This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
Shanghai remains in the early stages.
    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r2">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not</span>
<span class="r4">just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in </span>
<span class="r4">North America on the order of </span><span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4"> million new roofs per year.</span>
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla  network app before full autonomy and change
the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
    If so when will this happen?
    Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.
    Elon Musk

Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a bundle, yes.
    Elon Musk

Well, I think it&#x27;s – it probably will make sense to have like to enable car sharing in advance of the kind of sort of 
drive robo-taxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before full self-driving is approved by regulators.
