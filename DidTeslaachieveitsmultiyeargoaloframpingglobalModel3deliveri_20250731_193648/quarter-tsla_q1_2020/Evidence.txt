--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #22]  After the ****Model** 3** ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
2. [Sentence #57]  So **Model** Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the ****Model** 3** and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
3. [Sentence #66]  And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly **global** manufacturer with major factories in ****North** **America****, **China** and **Europe** and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
4. [Sentence #76]  This is our second large-scale product launch since ****Model** 3** in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
5. [Sentence #80]  We also announced a long-range and performance variant of ****Model** 3** for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in **China**.
6. [Sentence #95]  **Model** Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai.
7. [Sentence #100]  Note that one of the most important aspects of **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
8. [Sentence #135]  And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range ****Model** 3** basically tomorrow, **China** time.
9. [Sentence #140]  And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the ****Model** 3** in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
10. [Sentence #380]  And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to ****Model** 3** as well, and so we have experience with that both with ****Model** 3** in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
