[Year 2020] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #22]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) After the ****Model** 3** ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
2. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) In Q1, we produced more **Model** Ys in the first quarter than **Model** 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
3. [Sentence #57]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) So **Model** Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the ****Model** 3** and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
4. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly **global** manufacturer with major factories in ****North** **America****, **China** and **Europe** and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
5. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) This is our second large-scale product launch since ****Model** 3** in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
6. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We also announced a long-range and performance variant of ****Model** 3** for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in **China**.
7. [Sentence #95]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Model** Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai.
8. [Sentence #100]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Note that one of the most important aspects of **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
9. [Sentence #135]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range ****Model** 3** basically tomorrow, **China** time.
10. [Sentence #140]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the ****Model** 3** in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
11. [Sentence #262]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) It’s not like ****model** 3** and Y – ****Model** 3** and Y also – they're way better than any other cars to the best of my knowledge.
12. [Sentence #380]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to ****Model** 3** as well, and so we have experience with that both with ****Model** 3** in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
13. [Sentence #391]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) But for a five-seater **Model** Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the ****Model** 3** once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].
14. [Sentence #565]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) And we'll be doing ****Model** 3** and Y for the eastern half of ****North** **America****.
15. [Sentence #567]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) But we expect California to do **Model** S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of ****North** **America****.
16. [Sentence #633]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on **Model** Y in Fremont, and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai.
17. [Sentence #659]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond ****Model** 3**, Y and the Cybertruck?
18. [Sentence #880]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with ****Model** 3**, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in ****Model** 3** in **China** and that that'll be in volume production later this year.
19. [Sentence #886]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of **Model** Y.
20. [Sentence #982]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) And as we said before, the **Model** Y cost structure and ****Model** 3** cost structure will converge.
21. [Sentence #983]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) They're not quite there, **Model** Y is still slightly more expensive than ****Model** 3**, and it's not yet at full production.
22. [Sentence #1030]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) ****Model** 3**, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.
23. [Sentence #1259]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) As were previous investments in ****Model** 3** Shanghai and **Model** Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
24. [Sentence #1262]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in ****Model** 3** in Shanghai and **Model** Y in Fremont.
25. [Sentence #1622]  (TSLA_Q3_2020) Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally **Model** Y and **China** ****Model** 3** gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont ****Model** 3**?
26. [Sentence #1811]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We ramped the ****Model** 3** in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
27. [Sentence #1911]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to ****Model** 3** production and building.
28. [Sentence #2004]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in ****North** **America****.
29. [Sentence #2080]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for ****Model** 3**, it's approaching the high 200s.
30. [Sentence #2133]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and ****North** **America****.
