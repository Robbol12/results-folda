America, Europe, and China?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">66</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
    So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model <span class="r2">3</span> and just despite 
being a bigger car that weighs more.
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in</span>
<span class="r5">North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> million units a year.</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">565</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.
    We&#x27;re also very excited to announce that we&#x27;re going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
    It&#x27;s going to be right near Austin.
    It will be about -- I&#x27;ll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be a lot of questions.
    But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and <span class="r2">15</span> minutes from Downtown Austin, and it&#x27;s 
about <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> acres, and we&#x27;re going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning.
    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
    And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll be doing Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Y for the eastern half of North America.</span>
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.
    Let&#x27;s see, is there anything more I want to say about?
    There&#x27;s a lot of information.
    So anything, guys?
    All right.
    Well, I&#x27;m sure they have lots of questions.
    We&#x27;ve already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">135</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r5">3</span>
<span class="r5">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    <span class="r8">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r8">]</span> But before we jump into the Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, just to recap the year, <span class="r2">2020</span> was a defining year for us on many levels.
    Despite a challenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering <span class="r2">0.5</span> million cars.
    I&#x27;d just like to, once again, thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort.
    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span class="r2">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span class="r2">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
    We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We ramped the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai to more than </span><span class="r5">5</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow </span>
<span class="r5">rapidly.</span>
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span class="r2">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.
    Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we&#x27;re super excited to announce the new Model S and Model X
are in production now and will be delivered in February.
    So we&#x27;ve been able to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X.
    And Model S will be delivered in February and X a little later.
    The Model S Plaid, and we&#x27;re actually in production now, and we&#x27;ll be delivering next month.
    So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior.
    There are actually a lot of great things about this.

    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> for our road map, which will positively impact </span>
<span class="r5">ASPs in China.</span>
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.

    We&#x27;ve already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work.
    So it&#x27;s already underway, started this weekend.
    Let&#x27;s see, moving on to other subjects, Solar.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">659</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as 
well as movements in working capital.
    A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
    While our AR balance is usually about <span class="r2">20</span>% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
    First, overall, less than <span class="r2">30</span>% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
    Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain 
methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted 
significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
    Third, roughly <span class="r2">40</span>% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV 
incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span class="r2">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5"> million units </span>
<span class="r5">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span class="r5">beyond Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
    So it&#x27;s a long way to go with those.
    I think we&#x27;ll do the obvious things.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla?
    What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
    Elon Musk

Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">880</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio.
    It didn&#x27;t make sense up to now to do it.
    But we&#x27;ll be ready.
    And that&#x27;s maybe a little biased.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this.
    And we have a lot of very unique technology that we&#x27;re always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi.
    It will be just awesome.
    Yes.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And there’s like two general classes of cell.
    There&#x27;s like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer 
range.
    Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack 
you have to subtract in cargo.
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive </span>
<span class="r5">coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total </span>
<span class="r5">vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron </span>
<span class="r5">phosphate battery pack in Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.</span>
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard <span class="r2">3</span> Range version of Model Y.
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
    Elon Musk

Well, I&#x27;d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
    Okay.
    Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don&#x27;t wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some 
high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
    As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is our second large-scale product launch since Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in </span><span class="r5">2017</span><span class="r5"> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on </span>
<span class="r5">cost control and ramp efficiency.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And one more question is from retail investors.
    What is Tesla doing to improve service experience?
    Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service.
    Now it&#x27;s impossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out.
    Jerome?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    Well, as far as best service, no service.
    So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
    In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
    So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
    And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than </span><span class="r5">40</span><span class="r5">% of all visits in North America.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to push that to <span class="r2">50</span>% this year.
    In <span class="r2">50</span>% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
    So we&#x27;re trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
    And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
    We have about -- we have actually <span class="r2">140</span> service centers right now in North America.
    For <span class="r2">100</span> out of those <span class="r2">140</span>, you can get appointments in less than <span class="r2">10</span> days.
    And we&#x27;re going to make sure it&#x27;s all service centers are -- have a short wait time.
    We&#x27;re accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening.
    In North America, we opened <span class="r2">11</span> centers in December, and we have plans to open <span class="r2">46</span> in the first half of this year.
    So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing to improve service.
    In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app.
    Really, we want all communications to go through the app, the tesla app.
    And we are trying to move away from the phone.

    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zach, do you want to – I don’t know, Zach and Jerome?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

The – what we&#x27;re seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is pretty dynamic space, but it&#x27;s overall not particularly 
limiting on a rule basis, but what we&#x27;re going to expect is to have to work with regulators to demonstrate really, 
really high reliability, as Elon said before.
    The rest of the world is fairly dynamic.
    In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally not reaching past Level <span class="r2">3</span> right now with some impetus to start 
working on new working groups to reach past that.
    And China showed an interest in working on Level <span class="r2">4</span> or even Level <span class="r2">5</span> later this year.
    So we expect a pretty dynamic <span class="r2">2021</span> in the regulatory space.
    We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high 
reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
    And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
    Obviously, there&#x27;s a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
    Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you&#x27;re migrating some of your exposure around some of your 
raw material costs?
    Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in </span>
<span class="r5">particular, both between Asia and North America.</span>
    But we&#x27;re also looking forward to pricing, and we&#x27;re watching this very closely for all the components.
    We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you&#x27;re going to 
have enough quantity to support the growth, <span class="r2">50</span>% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate 
sharing of the risk.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
    Please go ahead.
    Dan Levy

Hi, good evening.
    Thank you.
    Two questions, one on <span class="r2">2021</span> and just one on capital.
    First, on <span class="r2">2021</span>.
    Any expectations for what we should see on regulatory credit sales?
    And then the second question is on capital.
    Obviously, you raised a lot of capital in <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering some of the maturities?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">95</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite

    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>
<span class="r5">in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai.</span>
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.

    Elon Musk

Zach?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    A couple of thoughts there for Y.
    The first is, it does carry a higher ASP.
    So on the revenue side, it carries a higher ASP than Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And the deliveries that we started with were of the higher ASP versions of the cars.
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r2">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> as well, and so we have experience with</span>
<span class="r5">that both with Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.</span>
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
    But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> once we have 
reached say, <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> or <span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units or something like that and…<span class="r8">[</span>Technical Difficulty<span class="r8">]</span>.

    And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r2">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already </span>
<span class="r5">lower than the cost to produce the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.</span>
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.
    That&#x27;s one always has to do that in a crisis, and just thinking about our core beliefs and what do we want to do.
    And we came to a conclusion that at the right move was actually to continue to expand rapidly, continue to invest in
the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.
    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
    But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.

    <span class="r8">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r8">]</span> Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; After the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.</span>
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.

    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for your support over the last quarter.
    In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with the hard work and the resiliency that you all 
have shown.
    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to 
personnel and non-critical patent projects.
    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>
<span class="r5">Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai.</span>
    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span class="r2">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span class="r2">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span class="r2">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span class="r2">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
    We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity.
    And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
    Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2.
    This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting 
of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&amp;A within operating expenses.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $<span class="r2">8.6</span> billion, which included free cash flows 
of over $<span class="r2">400</span> million.
    This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as 
well as movements in working capital.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">18</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">57</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to <span class="r2">391</span> miles for Model S 
and <span class="r2">351</span> miles for Model X.
    Actually, we said that, actually, the model -- the real Model S range is <span class="r2">400</span> miles, but when we did the last EPA 
test, unfortunately, ATA left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.
    And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost <span class="r2">2</span>% of its range.
    And as a result, it had a <span class="r2">391</span> test.
    As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we&#x27;re actually confident that we will achieve a 
<span class="r2">400</span>-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months -- the true range of 
the Model S for the past two months has been <span class="r2">400</span> miles.
    And of course, we&#x27;re not stopping there.
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and just despite </span>
<span class="r5">being a bigger car that weighs more.</span>
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">19</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1262</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r2">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r2">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.
    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
    In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and 
Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r2">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r2">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r2">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r2">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r2">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
    As were previous investments in Model <span class="r2">3</span> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have 
already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
    Looking forward to <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r2">2</span> billion to $<span class="r2">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and </span>
<span class="r5">location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai and</span>
<span class="r5">Model Y in Fremont.</span>
    Financing cash flows were $<span class="r2">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span class="r2">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span class="r2">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r2">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r2">500</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
    While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it&#x27;s possible with tight execution across the company.
    So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
    I&#x27;ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few 
comments.
    RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
    First, I&#x27;d like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done.
    Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we&#x27;re poised for continued strong growth in Energy storage and 
solar.
    Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business and deployments will continue to expand rapidly as 
the product reaches full capacity.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">20</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1911</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As we increase production rates, volumes will skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will
be a part of this year&#x27;s story and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals.
    Specifically for Q1, our volumes will have the benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai, However, S and X 
production will be low due to the transition to the newly architected products.
    Additionally, we&#x27;re working extremely hard to manage through the global semiconductor shortage, as well as port 
capacity, which may have a temporary impact.
    We will continue to invest heavily in supercharging and service capacity while driving reductions on cost, including
OpEx as a percentage of revenue.
    Global demand continues to outpace production, and we&#x27;re moving as quickly as we can with a focus on the long-term.
    I look forward to providing updates on progress throughout the year.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can jump straight into questions from <span class="r8">[</span>Safe<span class="r8">]</span>  Technologies.
    The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from being the market share
leader in solar?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    So we&#x27;re actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year.
    And we had our best quarter since, I think, <span class="r2">2018</span> in Q4.
    So we do actually expect to become the market leader in solar and then go far beyond it.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had to devote the whole company to Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> production </span>
<span class="r5">and building.</span>
    We basically take the whole company, including people that work around solar and have work on cars.
    But now we got a little more bandwidth, we&#x27;re putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growing rapidly.
    So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Another really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure, which then allows 
us to have industry-leading pricing.
    And so that&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve accomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the 
place that it needs to be and I think I’ve mentioned, this is a really important part industry-leading pricing to become
the leader in the space.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And actually important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwall and the Tesla Retrofit Solar
and Tesla Roof.
    And we&#x27;re confident we&#x27;ll have excellent integration – excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, 
whether it&#x27;s retrofit or but  roof before the end of the year.
    So it&#x27;s really – I think we&#x27;ve got a good strategy.
    As Zach mentioned, we&#x27;re focused on reducing the amount of time and the complexity of the install, and we&#x27;re making 
great progress in that regard.
    And I think we&#x27;ll have something that&#x27;s really dialed in this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to their next vehicle?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">21</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">262</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r9">[PILOT]</span>
    We&#x27;re also seeing a lot of interest outside of North America.
    So we expect this to be a product that is international and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from 
China on the Solar Roof.
    So we&#x27;re confident this will be a very significant product for the company over time.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla&#x27;s plan to enter the residential and/or commercial HVAC market?
    Can you provide some basics of how your system will work?
    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span class="r2">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span class="r2">16</span> or <span class="r2">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not like model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Y – Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Y also – they&#x27;re way better than any other cars to the best of my </span>
<span class="r5">knowledge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal 
car.
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span class="r2">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
    So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new 
Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.

    Pierre Ferragu

Thank you.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.
    Please go ahead.
    Dan Levy

Hi.
    Good evening.
    Thank you.
    Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> gross margin was in the </span>
<span class="r5">quarter relative to Fremont Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">?</span>
    And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
    Or was there also FSD revenues?
    Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
    On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
    It&#x27;s not particularly material in the $<span class="r2">10</span> million range for the quarter.
    With respect to product margins, what we&#x27;re seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really 
across every product.
    Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
    Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
    But we&#x27;ve guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model <span class="r2">3</span> built in Fremont costs.
    It&#x27;s not quite there, and it&#x27;s also a bit of a moving target as Model <span class="r2">3</span> Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to
come down with that.
    But we&#x27;re generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">23</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">391</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
    And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model <span class="r2">3</span> as well, and so we have experience with
that both with Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> once we have </span>
<span class="r5">reached say, </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> or </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].</span>

    Thank you.

    Operator

The next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.
    Please go ahead.
    Ben Kallo

Hey, thank you very much.
    Just wondering about the cell strategy.
    In Reno, you have, obviously, integrated there.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">24</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1030</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Zach Kirkhorn

Sure.
    I&#x27;ve mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit.
    We manage the business, said differently, we don&#x27;t manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits 
will contribute in a significant way to the future.
    I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in <span class="r2">2020</span> relative to <span class="r2">2019</span>, and it will continue for some period of 
time, but eventually, the stream of regulatory credits will reduce.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, it&#x27;s worth telling that we&#x27;re -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received <span class="r2">0</span> federal tax credit.
    Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $<span class="r2">7</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> pack tax credit.
    And yet our sales have continued to do well.
    Yes.
    Zach Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
    That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.</span>
    You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, 
particularly full self-driving, there&#x27;s the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will 
expand as we release more features.
    And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network.
    Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
    There&#x27;s still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the 
company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
    So we continue to see efficiencies there.
    So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
    And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
    So I hear your point on the <span class="r2">5</span>% and the <span class="r2">1</span>%.
    We&#x27;re on a bit of a journey here, and we&#x27;re continuing to be partner .
    Toni Sacconaghi

Thank you.
    And if I could just follow-up, Elon, you&#x27;ve talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really trying to
drive EV adoption globally.
    So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make 
your cars more affordable and broader?
    It feels like, historically, you&#x27;ve always picked the path of, I&#x27;d rather drive more growth and more adoption 
because ultimately, that&#x27;s the mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price 
reductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that&#x27;s been an 
ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company has made.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">982</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model <span class="r2">3</span>?
    And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
    You&#x27;re in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you&#x27;re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
    What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span class="r2">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span class="r2">5</span>% to <span class="r2">10</span>% a month, from <span class="r2">40</span> -- it was 
like <span class="r2">40</span>% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like <span class="r2">80</span>% by the end of this year, maybe more.
    Zach Kirkhorn

There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I will say it like this.
    The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
    Zach Kirkhorn

And so far, we&#x27;re in negotiations with -- for Berlin and we&#x27;ve awarded a lot of business.

    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today&#x27;s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r8">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r8">]</span> Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.</span>
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">27</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1259</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I think it&#x27;s reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the health of the core
business.
    On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from <span class="r2">18.7</span>% to <span class="r2">23.7</span>%, with some of 
our programs achieving greater than <span class="r2">25</span>% gross margin.
    Keep in mind that inefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2.
    We continue to reduce our manufacturing and operational costs.
    We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend of locally built and delivered cars, which has increased 
from under <span class="r2">50</span>% at the beginning of last year to over <span class="r2">70</span>% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction 
strategy.
    We are also seeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the fleet.
    Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service 
operations.
    In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and 
Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
    Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we&#x27;re continuing to make progress on that front.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $<span class="r2">14.5</span> billion, which includes free cash flows of $<span class="r2">1.4</span> billion, our 
highest yet.
    Our operating cash flows were $<span class="r2">2.4</span> billion, including a $<span class="r2">600</span> million benefit from working capital as we&#x27;ve made 
progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
    Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
    Capital expenses grew to $<span class="r2">1</span> billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As were previous investments in Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we&#x27;re expecting these programs to have </span>
<span class="r5">already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.</span>
    Looking forward to <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $<span class="r2">2</span> billion to $<span class="r2">2.5</span> 
billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
    This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as
investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
    While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and 
location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and
Model Y in Fremont.
    Financing cash flows were $<span class="r2">4.5</span> billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $<span class="r2">5</span> billion equity
raise in September.
    Note that we&#x27;re currently expecting over $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 
<span class="r2">2021</span> conversions, but also our <span class="r2">2022</span> and <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
    We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency 
across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
    We&#x27;ve made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
    We&#x27;re also aiming to achieve our original <span class="r2">2020</span> guidance of <span class="r2">500</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> deliveries despite the operational interruptions 
earlier in the year.
    While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it&#x27;s possible with tight execution across the company.
    So, congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year.
    I&#x27;ll hand it over to RJ Johnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a few 
comments.
    RJ Johnson

Thank you, Zach.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">28</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">983</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region.
    You&#x27;re in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you&#x27;re relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai.
    What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin?
    And what your Texas factory is going to be?
    Thank you.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
    And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model <span class="r2">3</span> cost structure will converge.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.</span>
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span class="r2">5</span>% to <span class="r2">10</span>% a month, from <span class="r2">40</span> -- it was 
like <span class="r2">40</span>% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like <span class="r2">80</span>% by the end of this year, maybe more.
    Zach Kirkhorn

There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I will say it like this.
    The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
    Zach Kirkhorn

And so far, we&#x27;re in negotiations with -- for Berlin and we&#x27;ve awarded a lot of business.
    Also a lot of suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe that are eager to support the factory in Berlin.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">29</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">886</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    It will be just awesome.
    Yes.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And there’s like two general classes of cell.
    There&#x27;s like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer 
range.
    Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack 
you have to subtract in cargo.
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
    What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive 
coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total 
vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model <span class="r2">3</span>, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron 
phosphate battery pack in Model <span class="r2">3</span> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> Range version of Model Y.</span>
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
    Elon Musk

Well, I&#x27;d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
    Okay.
    Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don&#x27;t wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some 
high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
    As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
    Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an 
environmentally-sensitive way.
    So, hopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies.
    Please get nickel.
    With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for Range is going to be just in U.S. EPA terms 
approximately <span class="r2">300</span> miles.
    So, I think people will really come to expect that as some number close to <span class="r2">300</span> miles as normal.
    That&#x27;s a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, like, is it very hot outside or very cold?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">30</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2080</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I find that the customers in China, Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in the world.
    Their attention to detail is incredible.
    So they -- I&#x27;m confident that they will buy FSD as soon as it’s working on time.
    And we hopefully that is later this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
    What&#x27;s the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.</span>
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span class="r2">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span class="r2">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
    So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
