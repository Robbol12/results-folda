across North America, Europe, and China?

    And so, I think there’s merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add to that, the journey we’ve been on for the last <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months on being more efficient and how we spend 
money has really changed the full trends of the company.
    It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well.
    And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
    So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
    Elon Musk

And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $<span class="r2">500</span> million.
    So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to...</span>

<span class="r4">Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.</span>
    It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated 
to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for 
customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
    So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    That makes sense.
    Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was 
focused on closing storefronts.
    A fair amount of noise made around that.
    And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">66</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
    And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will 
fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This was a $</span><span class="r4">1.5</span><span class="r4"> billion reduction from our </span><span class="r4">2018</span><span class="r4"> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two </span>
<span class="r4">factors.</span>
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">33</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
    Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America 
experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
    This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global 
deliveries occurring in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made </span>
<span class="r4">several years ago.</span>
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
    They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model <span class="r2">3</span> more than they ever wanted a 
vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally 
than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the 
Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.

    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those

    <span class="r6">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r6">]</span> But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.

    Martin Viecha

And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon should current owners that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?
    Elon Musk

I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don’t 
really have it in the car for probably about <span class="r2">2</span> or <span class="r2">3</span> months.
    That’s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the 
Version <span class="r2">2</span> hardware.
    So, just no need to rush to the – get your computer replaced.
    It’s like <span class="r2">2</span> to <span class="r2">3</span> months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then.
    One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California</span>
<span class="r4">or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.</span>
    But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
    So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada 
and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will 
hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.

between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
    Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or
reservation list maybe telling you?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and <span class="r2">3</span>.
    The standard range plus Model <span class="r2">3</span> with autopilot included at $<span class="r2">39</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and 
affordable to probably something on the order like the top <span class="r2">40</span>% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.

    Elon Musk

In Q2, we don’t we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the significant ones that we’re aware of.
    Maynard Um

Okay.
    And I guess there was some concern out there that Model <span class="r2">3</span> was cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different
vehicle classes, and it doesn’t sound like you’re saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence 
that proves, disproves this?
    Any thoughts there would be helpful.
    Elon Musk

No, they’re reducing through different market segments.
    Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And also, not only <span class="r2">3.5</span>% of our trade-ins for Model <span class="r2">3</span> are coming from Model S. So, it’s from all the Model <span class="r2">3</span> trade-ins, 
Model S accounts for a super, super tiny portion.
    Elon Musk

Yes, for sure.
    People Model S just want to trade it in for another Model S or maybe an X.

Martin Viecha

Okay let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Dan Galves from Wolfe Research.
    Dan Galves

Hi thanks everybody.
    A couple of questions.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; One, you mentioned a $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is </span>
<span class="r4">that a number like since the February </span><span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4"> price adjustments?</span>
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
    And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over <span class="r2">50</span>% 
of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .
    Dan Galves

That’s really helpful.
    And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
    So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
    But on Model <span class="r2">3</span>, whatever your assumption is within the <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is 
for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, does your current order flow support that?
    Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
    Elon Musk

I think we’ll I think we’ll be fine.

    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
    They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model <span class="r2">3</span> more than they ever wanted a 
vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally </span>
<span class="r4">than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the </span>
<span class="r4">Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.</span>
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.
    So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">75</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This led to a binary inflow of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.</span>
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
    We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee 
of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes.
    There is an additional $<span class="r2">67</span> million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We don’t feel constrained at <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    Colin Rusch

And then as you look at the Maxwell Technology integration, post close, how quickly do you think you’ll be able to 
integrate that technology into the battery production?
    And could you comment on potential for chemistry and form factor changes as you get it integrated?
    Elon Musk

I mean, you’re really asking some pretty super secret sauce questions here.
    I think yes, we’ll have I think we’ll probably have an Investor Day like an Autonomy Day maybe later this year or 
early next just to go over the cell and battery technology and future strategy.
    And think that will be very informative but we do recognize the criticality of this.
    Colin Rusch

Okay thank you so much guys.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.
    Joseph Spak

First question is really just a clarification on in the outlook of <span class="r2">25</span>% non-GAAP gross margin that you’re targeting.
    Is that over the mid-term or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year?
    And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach here, that’s  so we’re targeting for the end of the year, although internally, we are working towards 
S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The biggest lever there is actually two components.</span>
    One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there’s just a natural benefit there from the 
fixed cost absorption which will help us.
    But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we’re executing on over the course of the year.
    And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we’re seeing an increased take rate on our full
Self-Driving offering.
    And there are, revenue associated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there.
    And as that option becomes, approaches we roll out more, we will be able to apply more revenue on that.
    So all of these things together within our internal gives us .
    Elon Musk

Yes, I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually launched in a significant cost down because 
we essentially took the high volume, we’re driving units of the Model <span class="r2">3</span> which is extremely efficient magnet motor and 
product electronics and we made a version for that for the contract unit of S and X.
    And so, we’re actually able to get cost reduction while improving range and  of the car.
    That’s just <span class="r2">1</span> example.
    Joseph Spak

Okay.
    The second question is just looking at the <span class="r2">10</span>-K, you’ve notice $<span class="r2">4.9</span> billion purchase obligation, which I think is 
primarily related to Panasonic Giga <span class="r2">1</span>.
    And then Elon, in some of your communication, you’ve indicated production constraints.
    I guess the question is, does that $<span class="r2">4.9</span> billion correlate to reaching that <span class="r2">35</span> gigawatt hour rate?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">257</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Thanks.
    And I have a follow up.
    Elon Musk

I think we are just going to continue to report the absolute numbers.
    I think a point of detail just give those of you our bytes of Tesla that maybe sort of like data mine the situation 
and then try to turn it positive into negative.
    So we are just going to keep reporting report.
    We do give some more detailed information to insurance companies to help with rates.
    And obviously as we launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that information into
the insurance rates.
    So, we essentially have a substantial price and sort of arbitrage or information arbitrage opportunity where we have
direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and based on the car and then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, 
they would have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way.
    Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher.
    So we are just going to keep reporting the numbers at a broad stroke level, which I think is really what matters.
    Adam Jonas

Okay, I understand it.
    Elon Musk

That’s the safety.
    Adam Jonas

Okay.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And just as a follow-up, Elon and you kind of alluded a little bit, there is just so much drama around Tesla’s share</span>
<span class="r4">price and quarterly results.</span>
    From the outside at least, it looks like a huge distraction.
    And at the same time, there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital that is 
incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership.
    So how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?
    Elon Musk

Well, mate, I don’t want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private, but unfortunately, I think that ship has 
sailed, so<span class="r9">...</span>

Adam Jonas

But is it important?
    I mean, you think the company’s value is maximized being public?
    Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play the hand you’re dealt?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think this feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way.
    And I think Warren Buffett’s analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone 
stand at the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your house every day.
    It’s still the same house.
    Adam Jonas

Yes.
    Elon Musk

So, it’s a bit of a distraction at times, but I’m not sure what to do about it.
    Adam Jonas

Okay understood.
    Thanks.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">13</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">91</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
    We expect significant cost savings to come from this.
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.

of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes.
    There is an additional $<span class="r2">67</span> million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
    One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February <span class="r2">28</span> as well as the makeshift towards the standard range 
lineup which we launched.
    We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and
scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $</span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4">, </span>
<span class="r4">with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, 
the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
    As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
    From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
    So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
    As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity <span class="r2">50</span>% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. and 
then <span class="r2">50</span>% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
    And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model <span class="r2">3</span> platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for 
capital efficient expansion.
    In energy as well, as we have noted previously, <span class="r2">2019</span> is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements 
coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned 
investments in that.
    So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company 
and I am looking forward to the discussion.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zachary.
    Let’s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
    So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">135</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Can you speak to the energy side of the company specifically, the roadmap for when you see the energy side of things
really taking off and generating major revenue for the company?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    The challenge really is battery cells scarcity.
    As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as 
well as to full power on Powerpack.
    Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory
to produce cells just for Model <span class="r2">3</span> as opposed to Powerpack.
    So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the 
Powerpack.
    This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe <span class="r2">5</span>% to <span class="r2">10</span>% of cell outputs like current, J.B., 
like what do you guys think?
    J.B. Straubel

Yes, between <span class="r2">5</span>% and <span class="r2">10</span>%, something like that.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So, there are  in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a – quite a decent number of Powerwalls.
    And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world.
    The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don’t have to go through vehicle  are much more adaptable to using variety of 
cells from other cell providers.
    So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order 
of <span class="r2">300</span>% or some quite high number.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, sorry.</span>
    Yes, <span class="r2">300</span>, confirming it, <span class="r2">300</span>%.
    So this is a very big percentage growth rate.
    It’s much faster than an automotive.
    So over time, we expect that sort of growth rate would hopefully be able to continue and then battery storage will 
become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla’s business over time.
    We also have – we are also finding a significant increase in retrofit solar this year, because we have finally 
refined the product offering to be something that’s extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and 
install.
    So, to radically streamline process from what has been done before and we will have more to say on that possibly 
next week.
    And then the Solar Roof tile, we are on Version <span class="r2">3</span> of the design.
    That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last on 
the order of <span class="r2">30</span> years and because the warranty is sort of <span class="r2">20</span>, <span class="r2">25</span> years and so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar
Roof is necessarily slowed down by  which you can do accelerate aging on the roof and we want the installation process 
to be simple and easy, which is actually the Tesla Buffalo factory a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the 
team and we are looking forward to scaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question comes from Jeffrey, when and where will the Tesla semi production begin?
    Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
    Next year we will start production.
    We are very happy with driving the trucks extensively with I think so far quite amazing success, yes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We just used them all the time.
    We load them to maximum weight and continue to make improvements.
    Elon Musk

So, we have even used them to deliver some Model 3s.
    Jerome Guillen

Yes, that was fun.
    So, yes, we will start production next year.
    The location was not yet set, but it’s pretty clear that we make all the batteries and driving it in Reno.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    Elon Musk

Sparks technically.
    Jerome Guillen

Sparks, yes.
    Northern Nevada.
    Elon Musk

Yes, Northern Nevada.
    Martin Viecha

And perhaps the last question from retail, how soon should current owners that purchase FSD, get the new FSD computer?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">I think from features and functionality standpoint, I think there is no point getting the FSD upgrade if you don’t </span>
<span class="r4">really have it in the car for probably about </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> or </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> months.</span>
    That’s when we will start releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the 
Version <span class="r2">2</span> hardware.
    So, just no need to rush to the – get your computer replaced.
    It’s like <span class="r2">2</span> to <span class="r2">3</span> months before it becomes relevant and then it will obviously increase rapidly from then.
    One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
    For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California
or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
    But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
    So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada 
and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will 
hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you.
    Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
    Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
    Your guidance for <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere 
between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">16</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">324</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And given that you used up about $<span class="r2">2</span> billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren’t you potentially trying to go 
through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic.
    So why not raise capital?
    And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn’t do?
    Or wouldn’t do?
    And I have a follow up, please.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I don’t think raising capital should be substitute for making the company operate more effectively.
    So that in that sense, I think it’s just, it’s important to have strong financial discipline of the company and just
to make sure we don’t have extraneous expenses and we’re just being frugal with capital.
    If we keep raising capital every time, then it just takes we now have the forcing function improving the functional 
operation of the business.
    So, I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while.
    At this point, I do think there are it is similar to raising capital.
    That’s a but this is sort of probably about the right timing, but yes.
    Toni Sacconaghi

So, does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I hear you on the force and constraint, but I mean growth does eat cash especially in a capital-intensive </span>
<span class="r4">business.</span>
    If you really do believe you have a first mover advantage, why wouldn’t you want to push it as quickly as possible 
even if it meant raising capital in the short term.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    First of all, I’ll just say that I don’t think capital has been constrained on our growth thus far and the type of 
those fund in fact, if there was a final constraint on growth would’ve faced capital before now.
    But I think it is very important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we’re we have 
the appropriate financial discipline throughout the company and are spending money very efficiently.
    At this point, I think we are doing that.
    There’s more work to do, and Tesla today is far more efficient operating organization than it was a year ago.
    We’ve made dramatic improvements across the board.
    And so, I think there’s merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add to that, the journey we’ve been on for the last <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months on being more efficient and how we spend 
money has really changed the full trends of the company.
    It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well.
    And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
    So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
    Elon Musk

And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $<span class="r2">500</span> million.

    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
    Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America 
experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
    This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global 
deliveries occurring in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be </span>
<span class="r4">negatively impacted.</span>
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.
    They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model <span class="r2">3</span> more than they ever wanted a 
vehicle, they are willing to pay more to get a Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> has just begun and this segment is vastly larger internationally 
than it is in the U.S. We are continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the 
Model S and X production line to culminate the next generation of powertrains.
    So, we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more balanced powertrains for 
the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension 
system and to enable charging at <span class="r2">200</span> kilowatts, which is – and there are number of other small changes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
    So, we don’t have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the fleet.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect significant cost savings to come from this.</span>
    On the P&amp;L side, we incurred $<span class="r2">188</span> million of one-time adjustment that’s led through to net income.
    $<span class="r2">120</span> million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    This included a reserve for a potential increase to return it for a residual value guarantee and buyback guarantee 
of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and service volumes.
    There is an additional $<span class="r2">67</span> million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that flowed through.
    Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively 
impacted by $<span class="r2">501</span> million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.
    If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.
    Within automotive gross margin, Model <span class="r2">3</span> gross margin declined slightly to approximately <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    This is due to two factors.
    One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February <span class="r2">28</span> as well as the makeshift towards the standard range 
lineup which we launched.
    We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact, labor content warehousing and
scrap are the examples of double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.
    In spite of launching the standard range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, 
with the majority of our orders being from long-range bearings of Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.

    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash

    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.

experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.

    If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it.
    And we also introduced a loyalty program, where if somebody is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance 
Model S or X, they get their first upgrade for free.
    So this is – yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.
    So, they have a longer range.
    The Model S now has a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles.
    This would actually be at a range of <span class="r2">370</span> miles and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop 
all the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds and they said they could have even gone faster 
and they were any headwind as well.
    So, this is pretty remarkable that electric car could go nonstop between the two biggest cities in California.

    In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.
    Two major pieces here is the volume reduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our 
margin as well as the pricing actions that we took on February <span class="r2">28</span>.
    Even though S and X have been in production for a while, we still continue to make operational improvements there, 
the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.
    As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon’s sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.
    From a financial standpoint, what we have effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge and assets 
that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.
    So, Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this.
    As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity <span class="r2">50</span>% for Giga Shanghai as compared to Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. and 
then <span class="r2">50</span>% our internal forecast that we are executing against is actually better than that.
    And Model Y, as we have noted, is built on the Model <span class="r2">3</span> platform, so we are able to leverage the knowledge there for 
capital efficient expansion.
    In energy as well, as we have noted previously, <span class="r2">2019</span> is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements 
coming there and the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we planned 
investments in that.
    So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I personally never felt more excited about the future of the company 
and I am looking forward to the discussion.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zachary.
    Let’s take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been submitting their questions on say.com.
    So, the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase of Maxwell Technologies?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; What is holding that back?</span>
    Elon Musk

Jonathan, do you want to?
    Jonathan Chang

Yes, hi, it’s Jonathan Chang as our Counsel here.
    Right now, we are just going through approvals with the SEC.
    There is not a whole lot of things holding it back.
    We are on schedule, we are on track.
    Right now, we are looking to close in mid-May.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Thanks.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in order to further simplify the 
ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety of driving in Autopilot?
    The insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla ownership right now.
    Elon Musk

The answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product and we hope to launch that in about a month.
    It will be much more compelling than anything else out there.

    One other comment I will make in case nobody asked this exclusive especially.
    For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California
or Nevada and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.
    But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y.
    So, we don’t expect this in anyway to delay production of Model Y, but it’s hardly a very close call between Nevada 
and California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont, but those are the two options and we will 
hopefully be able to make the decision in the next few weeks.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Sherry, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue.
    Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you.
    Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
    Ryan Brinkman

Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
    Your guidance for <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests somewhere 
between <span class="r2">35</span>% and <span class="r2">45</span>% sequential growth from the first half to the second.
    Can you talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth and in particular what the order book or
reservation list maybe telling you?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We do see strong demand for vehicles, both S, X and <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The standard range plus Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> with autopilot included at $</span><span class="r4">39</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">500</span><span class="r4"> is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and </span>
<span class="r4">affordable to probably something on the order like the top </span><span class="r4">40</span><span class="r4">% income earners in the U.S. and Europe.</span>
    So, it’s – I think we will see a lot of interest and demand in that.
    We are.
    And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X 
upgrade and this really is kind of a game-changer of an upgrade.
    So, I think we are seeing an uptick in demand and we expect to see that to be quite significant.
    And we are also out of the seasonality of Q1 with few people just generally don’t like buying cars in winter and we 
are getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff, which for us ended in the U.S. on December <span class="r2">31</span>.
    So, these were all very positive factors.
    We also have just a lot of markets where there is program or tapped into demand, especially for Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    So we will be really saying the right-hand drive Model <span class="r2">3</span> and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive 
countries.
    Overall, I feel really good about the way things are headed.
    Ryan Brinkman

Okay, thanks.
    And then my follow up, sorry, as you said on previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont, 
because it was I think you said packed to the gills.
    I heard today that it is now a close call between California and Nevada.
    Is anticipated demand for Fremont built vehicles less than was previously thought or have you managed to maybe find 
more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production method?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">23</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">62</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I mean, I have never – back when I was driving gasoline cars, I always have to stop at the gas station.
    This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception.
    And there is also an increase in power, accelerates faster, just better in every way.
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
    And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will 
fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The global expansion of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> was a huge theme within the quarter.</span>

that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.

    First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $<span class="r2">2.2</span> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.

Just to add to that, the journey we’ve been on for the last <span class="r2">12</span> to <span class="r2">18</span> months on being more efficient and how we spend 
money has really changed the full trends of the company.
    It enabled us to accelerate a number of cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements 
in operating expenses as well.
    And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately our European 
facility, our CapEx capacity has come down significantly through the work of the team here.
    So, I think it has been a very productive journey for us.
    Elon Musk

And technically, we did raise some big capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $<span class="r2">500</span> million.
    So that we want to make sure that we don’t have to grow on level capital stuff under the Shanghai factory.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Now let’s go to the next question please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.
    Alex Potter

Hi guys, I was wondering when you say obviously the logistical challenges were a headwind in the quarter.
    You talked about trying to regionally balance your deliveries going forward.
    Is that basically saying that people in Europe and China are just going to need to wait longer to take their 
deliveries and you’re going to try to emphasize more in North America in order to<span class="r9">...</span>

Elon Musk

No, they would actually receive their cars sooner.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It just means that instead of building cars in batches, where, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated </span>
<span class="r4">to China, Europe cars, and the second half is dedicated to North American cars that we blend vehicle production for </span>
<span class="r4">customers throughout the world, throughout the quarter.</span>
    And that this  we don’t want a situation again like quite like we had in Q1 where essentially all the cars were 
arriving at customers worldwide at the same time.
    We literally delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries were in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    That’s insane.
    So, I think we need to unwind that.
    I suppose it’s not a great customer experience because we’re shorthanded and then we have to redeploy like fuel from
that are working in sales, HR, legal, engineering, everyone just to deliver cars.
    And then we then they can do their regular jobs.
    So, it just makes sense to just plan the production according to demand throughout the quarter.
    Alex Potter

Okay.
    That makes sense.
    Then the second question, I guess on go to market, there were some period of time there where the company was 
focused on closing storefronts.
    A fair amount of noise made around that.
    And then it, look like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy.
    I was just wondering if there’s any update there.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">65</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And we are able to increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team and for us 
to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.
    So, with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
globally, we expect the order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and in commensurate with our production
levels.
    And I am very excited about the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will 
fundamentally transform transport as we know it.
    The Tesla Semi truck Model Y, improvements to Powerwall, Powerpack, the Solar Roof Version <span class="r2">3</span> on the energy side.
    And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product roadmap of any consumer product company in the 
world.
    And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued support.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thank you, Martin and thanks Elon as well.
    Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this was one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in 
the history of the company and it was ambitious even by Tesla’s standards.
    The global expansion of Model <span class="r2">3</span> was a huge theme within the quarter.
    We launched the standard range lineup for Model <span class="r2">3</span> product retooling from Model S and Model X, which Elon just talk 
about and suspension upgrade and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and work to do the corresponding impact
that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.
    So there is two key themes that I would like to discuss briefly and then we will open it up to Q&amp;A around cash and 
profitability for the quarter.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $</span><span class="r4">2.2</span><span class="r4"> billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</span>
    This was a $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction from our <span class="r2">2018</span> ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to two 
factors.
    The first is that we paid off $<span class="r2">920</span> million convertible note on March <span class="r2">1</span>.
    Note for those of you looking to the cash flow statement, $<span class="r2">188</span> million of this is flowing through our operating cash
flows.
    The balance to the $<span class="r2">1.5</span> billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
operations overseas.
    And the two components to this which we have discussed is that an international operation naturally commands 
additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not 
all of our cars will be delivered, both of these factors which occurred in Q1.
    We do not expect to repeat in Q2 and we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going 
forward.
    I will also note that we are tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries from month <span class="r2">1</span> in the history of 
the company.
    On the working capital point, as Elon noted, <span class="r2">50</span>% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of the 
quarter.
    This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in 
the second half.
    This led to a binary inflow of Model <span class="r2">3</span> cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.
    We also faced important issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries 
towards the final couple of days and weeks in the quarter.
    So, we are addressing this by regionally – by building regionally balanced and we have already executed on this for 
Model <span class="r2">3</span> and S and X will be implemented in the next week or two.
    The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">26</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">225</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2019]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Elon Musk

I think we expect demand to – we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2.
    And it might be a little better than normal.
    I don’t have a crystal ball, it’s hard for me to say, but my impression right now is that demand is quite solid, 
quite strong, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

And then my second question was briefly on<span class="r9">...</span>

Elon Musk

Sorry, Zach would like to<span class="r9">...</span>

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Well, just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X.
    We did reduce production in Q1 as was noted.
    That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer range vehicle out with the improved suspension
and we are in the process of increasing production backup over the course of Q2.
    So just for the pervasive expectations, we will exit Q2 at a higher production rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and
then return back to a more normal volume in Q3.
    It’s already increasing.
    Pierre Ferragu

And my follow-up was really on Q2 like with <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units you are getting back to fairly nice volumes and I am
surprised you don’t – you just still expect a loss.
    So maybe if you could take us through where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3 where you had a 
profit for similar volumes?
    How much of the loss in 2Q will be one-off costs, how much is the price points coming down in the mix and how much 
is related to pricing and other things?
    Elon Musk

Sure.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So quite a bit, but we think if we didn’t unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the first half of </span>
<span class="r4">the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and in the second half almost exclusively for North America.</span>
    And then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it’s West Coast or East Coast, then we could 
deliver more cars.
    But we think it is important to unwind this wave, because it ends up being sort of optimizing for one quarter, but 
really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just – not being a good expense for customers and pretty aggressive 
efforts from Tesla team.
    So if we have to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we can do it, but then we would be unable to unwind
this crazy wave of deliveries and it also helps our working capital within the quarter to not have the wave.
    And then, Zach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    No, I think you summarized it well, Elon.
    Two other things that I would add.
    One is we did make pricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margin.
    And so that’s part of what we will see in Q2.
    The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost efficiency of the business 
without sacrificing growth and that in combination with the efficiencies from unwinding the wave, is where we feel we 
will be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once all of those pieces are in place.

    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r6">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r6">]</span> But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    On Monday, we hosted our first ever Autonomy Investor Day showcasing our new in-house design full self-driving 
computer and our AI-based software trained by more than <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Tesla vehicles.
    All Tesla class vehicles today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over the year updates will 
enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as we said on Autonomy Day a
few days ago we think is somewhere between $<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and $<span class="r2">30</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a year, in some cases, perhaps more.
    We are the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for 
full self-driving.
    We are in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.
    And in <span class="r2">2020</span>, we expect to have <span class="r2">1</span> million robo taxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.
    We believe we will have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps – yes.
    Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America 
experienced last year as well as the massive increase in delivery volume too to China.
    As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have, because we booked vehicles and consumers support them.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half of our global </span>
<span class="r4">deliveries occurring in the final </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> days of Q1.</span>
    This was the most difficult logistics problem I have ever seen and I have seen some tough ones.
    So I will say it again, like we initially delivered the half of all vehicles produced or half of all deliveries 
occurred in literally the final <span class="r2">10</span> days of Q1.
    As a result, a large number of vehicles – vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2, which of course, Q1 net income to be 
negatively impacted.
    As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in time.
    The response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle bills throughout the quarter.
    This will make the – this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for 
customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the quarter.
    In Q1, Model <span class="r2">3</span> was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner up by almost <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    It’s worth just dwelling on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were made 
several years ago.
    There are literally – best knowledge zero predictions that this would happen if you go back just even <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years 
ago, an electric car would be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe over time we will be the 
best-selling premium car throughout the world.
    And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever.
    And that would be something similar in Switzerland as well.
    So, this is really an incredible achievement by the Tesla team.
    Since the introduction of standard range, standard range class, only <span class="r2">70</span>% of previous Model <span class="r2">3</span> have actually been 
non-premium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever paid for a car.

    I think Tesla just sort of I didn’t handle messaging of that well.
    I mean, that’s amplified by statement taking to an extreme where there was a misunderstanding.
    We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided they are in locations where 
there is high foot traffic and that are in our target market.
    So, we actually will continue to add stores in locations are no-brainers.

    One, you mentioned a $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP for North America Model 3s, can you give us a little bit more detail on kind of is 
that a number like since the February <span class="r2">28</span> price adjustments?
    Is that what you’re, kind of seeing as order flow?
    I’m sorry ASP is kind of the current order flow since those price adjustments?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, this is Zach.
    I mean, what we saw on February <span class="r2">28</span> when we launched the standard range, the standard range class variances, is that 
there’s pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly after it was announced.
    And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it’s starting the average ASP has actually been 
increasing each week ever since as the order rates stabilizes.
    And just under $<span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ASP represents the most recent one, and we think it’s starting to stabilize there.
    And we’ll see where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we’re seeing in North America is that over <span class="r2">50</span>% 
of our orders of the long-range variance in ASPs .
    Dan Galves

That’s really helpful.
    And the follow up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me put it this way.
    So, the I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after the upgrades.
    But on Model <span class="r2">3</span>, whatever your assumption is within the <span class="r2">90</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> to <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> Q2 deliveries, whatever that assumption is 
for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, does your current order flow support that?
    Or do you need something kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">I think we’ll I think we’ll be fine.</span>
    Yes, I don’t think there any major thing required.

    Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

Yes, thank you.
    Elon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital for about the last year, you sort
of shooed it as almost an evil thing and I think a lot of investors believe that the company might be better served and 
its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base.
    And given that you used up about $<span class="r2">2</span> billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren’t you potentially trying to go 
through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be unrealistic.
    So why not raise capital?
    And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn’t do?
    Or wouldn’t do?
    And I have a follow up, please.
    Elon Musk

Yes.

    And just as a follow-up, Elon and you kind of alluded a little bit, there is just so much drama around Tesla’s share
price and quarterly results.
    From the outside at least, it looks like a huge distraction.
    And at the same time, there is so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic capital that is 
incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership.
    So how important is it for Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?
    Elon Musk

Well, mate, I don’t want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private, but unfortunately, I think that ship has 
sailed, so<span class="r9">...</span>

Adam Jonas

But is it important?
    I mean, you think the company’s value is maximized being public?
    Is there just only so much you can do and you just got to play the hand you’re dealt?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think this feels like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic-depressive way.
    And I think Warren Buffett’s analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like having someone 
stand at the edge of your home and then just randomly yell different prices for your house every day.
    It’s still the same house.
    Adam Jonas

Yes.
    Elon Musk

So, it’s a bit of a distraction at times, but I’m not sure what to do about it.

Hi thanks.
    In the update letter, you talked about supplier limitations impacting production.
    Can you just talk about what that was and how long you think that might continue to impact you?

    Elon Musk

In Q2, we don’t we think we have two supplier interruptions, at least the significant ones that we’re aware of.
    Maynard Um

Okay.
    And I guess there was some concern out there that Model <span class="r2">3</span> was cannibalizing S and X despite them being all different
vehicle classes, and it doesn’t sound like you’re saying that at all, but I was just wondering if you had any evidence 
that proves, disproves this?

No, they’re reducing through different market segments.
    Yes.
