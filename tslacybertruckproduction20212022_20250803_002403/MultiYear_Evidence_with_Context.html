    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.

    And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume
by the end of this year.
    So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
    That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
    And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
    That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per 
kilometer, accounting everything.
    And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.</span>
    So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to 
thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
    They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked 
day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
    And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
    We only crossed <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> million units in the past <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> months recently.
    And we are -- we aspire to head to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million units a year.
    So, we’re basically <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span>% along the way towards our goal.
    And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.

    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.

    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.

    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.

    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">7</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3546</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000">SCALE ACHIEVED</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008000; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your 
logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to 
have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
    So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?</span>
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
    There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">8</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">3341</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2021]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    And as a result, we were able to grow almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span>% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last 
year.
    So, that&#x27;s a good result.
    But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same 
because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
    So, if we&#x27;d actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on
that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
    And the same is true of this year.
    So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
    It would not make any sense because we&#x27;ll still be part constrained.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.</span>
    That is most likely.
    But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
    So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we&#x27;re doing this year 
is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
    This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
    If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
    Capital equipment is distilled labor.
    So, what happens if you don&#x27;t actually have a labor shortage?

    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">25</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> model 
in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.

    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.

    And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?

    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span>.
    And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> Model Y?

    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> year in

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cars to Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>?
    Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And to be clear, for </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2023</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> will so far exceed the average -- 
the safety of the average human.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
    And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">products.</span>

    Elon Musk

On the rear casting.
    But this will transfer for improvement with the casting.
    So the casting is already way better than the rare body casting is already way better than the – on the way is done 
in the past where you’ve got <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">120</span> different parts that are welded together or bonded together with different alloys and 
then you have to put sealant in between all the various parts for water ingress and noise.
    So we’re already way better than that with current casting, but there’s still a lot of opportunities to reduce the 
master casting and also extend the casting to include more parts as well as adapt the rest of the vehicle for the fact 
that there’s a casting.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I was going to say the same thing, right?
    Like we are not just evaluating the pack and insulation either, it’s the pack plus the body, the integration, do we 
have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount.
    And I think we’ve gone through one iteration.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re going to do another one with Cybertruck.</span>
    I mean, we’re taking the learnings and doing – the next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture.
    That’s certainly a target.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how do you feel the progress of FSD is going?
    And does Andrej Karpathy is leaving have any significant impact on timelines or potential progress?
    Elon Musk

Well, since Andrej was writing all the code by himself, naturally, things have come to a grinding halt.
    It’s irony.

    Let’s go to the next one.
    The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Two questions I have.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; First is regarding the Cybertruck.</span>
    And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck

    Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?

    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> team for achieving <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.

    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory

    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> year in

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> cars to Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>?
    Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>.

    In fact, I think it will be very difficult.
    It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.
    But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi 
Aramco.
    And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet.
    I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential.
    So, we have an incredible product portfolio.
    I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, 
some of which you haven’t.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck.</span>
    We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi 
platform design.
    And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> gigawatt hours a 
year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> refining, we’re 
moving at top speed to do that.
    So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.
    <span style="color: #800080; text-decoration-color: #800080; font-style: italic">None</span> of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla.
    So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla 
team.
    You guys rock.
    You’re the ones making it happen.

    So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that 
are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
    The logistics costs are going to be much less.
    But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
    And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see 
what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
    Yes.
    Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
    Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.</span>
    And then, there&#x27;s a question of like, what&#x27;s the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
    There&#x27;s -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
    But if it&#x27;s not affordable, that will constrain people&#x27;s ability to buy it because they don&#x27;t have the money.
    I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
    That&#x27;s the thing that will really set the rate.
    Aspirationally, we&#x27;d like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we&#x27;d like Cybertruck to be at least
on the order of  vehicles a year.
    But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.

    Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
    Very good quarter.
    I had two quick questions.
    First is regarding the two upcoming factories in Berlin and Austin.
    Who are the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assembly lines?
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is related to Cybertruck.</span>
    Who is the supply looking at?
    If you look at the exoskeleton steel, is the supply for that material sufficient for immediate ramp up, I&#x27;ll say in 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">23</span>-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">24</span> time for Cybertruck?
    That&#x27;s all for me.
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    Sure.
    So obviously, as we&#x27;ve noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade for the exterior Cybertruck to 
meet both the durability in course of requirements required for an automotive world.

    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

Okay.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">and we know there are a lot of updates.</span>
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
