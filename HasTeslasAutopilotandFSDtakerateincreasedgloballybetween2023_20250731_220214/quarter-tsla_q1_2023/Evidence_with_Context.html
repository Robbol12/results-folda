Hi.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you&#x27;ve seen any significant positive or
negative change there?
    And also, given that you&#x27;ve reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?
    Thanks.

<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it&#x27;s a tricky pricing question, because the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">value of a car that is autonomous is enormous.</span>
    So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle.
    And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant.
    And it&#x27;s really -- yes.
    I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic.
    There&#x27;ll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta.
    But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy.
    And I hesitate to say this, but I think we&#x27;ll do it this year.

    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Indiscernible<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> rate of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we&#x27;ve now crossed over </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">150</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold"> million miles driven by Full Self-Driving </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">beta, and this number is growing exponentially.</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.

Thanks Martin.
    I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,</span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">features as we transition technologies.</span>
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
