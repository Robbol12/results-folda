    And from what we understand, and again, maybe I&#x27;m wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in 
images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less.
    Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn&#x27;t have pedal -- pedals or 
a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can&#x27;t make it work, not because the regulators, 
they&#x27;re blaming regulators.
    That&#x27;s misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets.
    So it&#x27;s just that their technology is not far.
    George Gianarikas

Right.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">price.</span>
    Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly?
    Thank you.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, we shared the  that there we&#x27;ve seen a meaningful increase.
    I don&#x27;t want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results.
    And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can&#x27;t describe it till the time 
we actually use it.
    And that&#x27;s why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how 
this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is.
    I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there&#x27;s a bias example, but I have a more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> mile commute into 
the factory almost every day.

    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.</span>
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
    And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.
    I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.

All right.

    Elon Musk

And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the high volume version of Optimus 
will also be produced here in Texas.

    Just a couple more.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?</span>
    Elon Musk

There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving.
    And I suspect there will be more over time.
    But we can&#x27;t comment on the details of those discussions.
    Travis Axelrod

All right.
    Thank you.
    And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
    Elon Musk

I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI.

    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.</span>
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
    Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping 
Cybertruck and Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished 
goods.
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.5</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, and maybe a </span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">12.6</span><span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>
<span style="color: #800000; text-decoration-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.</span>
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.
