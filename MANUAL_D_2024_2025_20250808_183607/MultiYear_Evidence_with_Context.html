    We&#x27;re currently studying approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span> gigawatts of data center demand within the substation engineering letters 
of authorization stage, which means that customers requested the company to begin the necessary engineering for new 
distribution and substation infrastructure required to serve the customer.
    There are also about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span> gigawatts of data center demand that have executed construction letters of authorization, 
which are contracts that enable construction of the required distribution and substation electric infrastructure to 
begin.
    Should customers in this stage elect to discontinue projects, they&#x27;re obligated to reimburse the company for our 
investment to date.
    Finally, the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span> gigawatts included in electrical service agreements, or ESA, represent contracts for electric service
between Dominion Energy and a customer.
    Each contract is structured for an individual account.
    By signing an ESA, the customer is committing to consuming a certain level of electricity annually, often with ramp 
schedules where the contracted usage grows over time.
    In aggregate, we have data center demand of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span> gigawatts as of July <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, which compares to around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> gigawatts
as of July <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span>.

    Turning to Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span>, let me update you on our transmission system planning.
    As I&#x27;ve shared previously, the PJM DOM zone is experiencing unprecedented load growth.
    This has resulted in a similarly unprecedented increase in both the quantity and size of delivery point requests for
transmission service on our system.
    For context, we&#x27;ve received <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">63</span> construction delivery point requests year-to-date September, representing nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">13</span> 
gigawatts of capacity.
    Since <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>, we&#x27;ve received <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">280</span> construction delivery point requests, representing nearly <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatts of capacity.
    We&#x27;ve recently begun implementing changes to our process that will only affect new delivery point requests.
    This will allow us to organize load requests into batches and serve them in the order they&#x27;re received.

    First, customers&#x27; needs.
    We&#x27;re ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency 
and decarbonization public policy goals, plus the very robust demand growth we&#x27;re observing in real time across our 
system.
    DEV&#x27;s weather-normal year-over-year sales growth rate through March was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.8</span>%, precisely in line with our full year 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> growth rate expectation of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span>%, driven by economic growth, electrification and accelerating data center 
expansion.
    The data center industry has grown substantially in Northern Virginia in recent years.
    In aggregate, we&#x27;ve connected <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">94</span> data centers with over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> gigawatts of capacity over the last approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5</span> years.
    We expect to connect an additional <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> data centers in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude, driven by one, number of data centers </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">requesting to be connected to our system; </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, the size of each facility; and </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, the acceleration of each facility&#x27;s ramp </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">schedule to reach full capacity.</span>
    For some context, historically, a single data center typically had a demand of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span> megawatts or greater.
    However, we&#x27;re now receiving individual requests for demand of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span> megawatts or greater and it hasn&#x27;t stopped 
there.
    We get regular requests to support larger data center campuses that include multiple buildings and require total 
capacity ranging from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> megawatts to as many as several gigawatts.
    Last month, PJM released its capacity auction planning parameters.
    The results align with our analysis of load growth and the need for requisite dispatchable supply resources included
in our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2023</span> IRP.
    This independent modeling also validates the need to expediently progress the recurring local and PJM regional 
transmission planning and expansion process and our decision to expedite numerous projects over the last <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> years.
    Second, what are we doing today?
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    As I&#x27;ve said before, we&#x27;re ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to
address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals plus the very robust demand growth we&#x27;re observing in real 
time across our system.
    This growth has been recognized by third parties.
    As just one example, Virginia was recently named America&#x27;s top state for business in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    This was Virginia&#x27;s record sixth time at the top of CNBC&#x27;s rankings and its third win in five years, a record 
unmatched by any other state since the study began in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2007</span>.
    For full-year <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, we expect DEV sales growth to be between <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span>%, driven by economic growth, 
electrification and accelerating data center expansion.
    It&#x27;s worth noting that in July, we registered six new all-time peak demand records and just as we expect, our 
customers likely had no idea of these demanding load conditions given the high-quality operational performance delivered
by our colleagues.
    The data center industry continues to grow in Virginia.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve connected nine new data centers year-to-date through July, consistent with our expectations to connect </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">15</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> data</span>

    Since <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2013</span>, we&#x27;ve averaged around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> data center connections per year.
    However, growth is accelerating in orders of magnitude, driven by the number of requests, the size of each facility 
and the acceleration of each facility&#x27;s ramp schedule to reach full capacity.
    We&#x27;re taking the steps necessary to ensure our system remains resilient and reliable.
    We had accelerated plans for new 500kv transmission lines and other infrastructure in Northern Virginia, and that 
remains on track.
    We were awarded over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">150</span> electric transmission projects totaling $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2.5</span> billion during the PJM open window last 
December.
    PJM&#x27;s latest open window, which commenced on July 15th is anticipated to be equal to or greater in investment needs 
as the RTO looks to accommodate data center growth both in Northern Virginia and beyond with additional transmission 
upgrades.
    We&#x27;re working expeditiously with PJM, the SCC, local officials and other stakeholders to fast track critical 
projects.

    Turning to our financing plan as shown on Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>.
    We&#x27;ve sold approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion of forward-settled common equity under our existing ATM program at a weighted 
average price of approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">57</span> and expect to complete $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of DRIP-related equity issuance by year-end.
    This is consistent with our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> common equity guidance.
    We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs in the context of our sizable growth capital 
spending program as appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for our strong credit 
ratings category.
    We remain focused on balance sheet conservatism and there is no change to our previously communicated credit-related
targets.
    Turning briefly to data centers.
    As a reminder from our fourth quarter update, we have approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatts of data center capacity in various 
stages of contracting, including what is now approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> gigawatts of capacity contracted under electric service 
agreements.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since our last call, we have not observed any evidence of slowing demand from data center customers across our </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">service area.</span>
    In conclusion, I&#x27;ll reiterate that I&#x27;m highly confident in our ability to deliver on our financial plan.
    The financial guidance has been built to be appropriately but also not unreasonably conservative to weather 
unforeseen challenges that may come our way.
    With that, I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Bob.

    Each contract is structured for an individual account.
    By signing an ESA, the customer is committing to consuming a certain level of electricity annually, often with ramp 
schedules where the contracted usage grows over time.
    In aggregate, we have data center demand of over <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">21</span> gigawatts as of July <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>, which compares to around <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">16</span> gigawatts

    William Appicelli

Okay.
    That&#x27;s helpful.
    And then I guess just more broadly, again, on the same topic.
    Can you just share a little bit about the process of evaluation with the data center developers and how you 
structure the contracts and their commitments in terms of having the load show up and so that you&#x27;re restructuring the 
cost profile appropriately to protect ratepayers?
    Robert Blue

Yes, Bill, great question.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; They -- our data centers are on the rate schedule that applies to all our large customers.</span>
    And that&#x27;s been that way for some time.
    And the State Corporation Commission would have to make any changes if we were talking about -- approve any changes 
if we&#x27;re talking about any changes to that, which not on the table at the moment.
    The sort of thinking about the way we structure contracts, they have contract minimum demands that they are 
obligated to achieve in order to cover the incremental cost of the infrastructure that we&#x27;re building for them.
    And that has been in place for us for some time.

    Turning to our financing plan as shown on Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span>.
    We&#x27;ve sold approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion of forward-settled common equity under our existing ATM program at a weighted 
average price of approximately $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">57</span> and expect to complete $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> million of DRIP-related equity issuance by year-end.
    This is consistent with our <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> common equity guidance.
    We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs in the context of our sizable growth capital 
spending program as appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for our strong credit 
ratings category.
    We remain focused on balance sheet conservatism and there is no change to our previously communicated credit-related
targets.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Turning briefly to data centers.</span>
    As a reminder from our fourth quarter update, we have approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span> gigawatts of data center capacity in various 
stages of contracting, including what is now approximately <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> gigawatts of capacity contracted under electric service 
agreements.
    Since our last call, we have not observed any evidence of slowing demand from data center customers across our 
service area.
    In conclusion, I&#x27;ll reiterate that I&#x27;m highly confident in our ability to deliver on our financial plan.
    The financial guidance has been built to be appropriately but also not unreasonably conservative to weather 
unforeseen challenges that may come our way.
    With that, I&#x27;ll turn the call over to Bob.

    Being very focused on affordability allows us to ensure customers are getting compelling value, coupled with high 
reliability.
    Turning to Slide <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">14</span> and the growth outlook in Virginia.
    Let me share a few thoughts on, first, our customers&#x27; needs; second, what&#x27;s being done to support them; and third, 
the impact to our long-term financial plan.
    First, customers&#x27; needs.
    We&#x27;re ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency 
and decarbonization public policy goals, plus the very robust demand growth we&#x27;re observing in real time across our 
system.
    DEV&#x27;s weather-normal year-over-year sales growth rate through March was <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.8</span>%, precisely in line with our full year 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span> growth rate expectation of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.5</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">5.5</span>%, driven by economic growth, electrification and accelerating data center 
expansion.
    The data center industry has grown substantially in Northern Virginia in recent years.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; In aggregate, we&#x27;ve connected </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">94</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> data centers with over </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> gigawatts of capacity over the last approximately </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> years.</span>
    We expect to connect an additional <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">15</span> data centers in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2024</span>.
    Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets.
    In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude, driven by one, number of data centers 
requesting to be connected to our system; <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span>, the size of each facility; and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, the acceleration of each facility&#x27;s ramp 
schedule to reach full capacity.
    For some context, historically, a single data center typically had a demand of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span> megawatts or greater.
    However, we&#x27;re now receiving individual requests for demand of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">60</span> to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">90</span> megawatts or greater and it hasn&#x27;t stopped 
there.
    We get regular requests to support larger data center campuses that include multiple buildings and require total 
capacity ranging from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span> megawatts to as many as several gigawatts.
    Last month, PJM released its capacity auction planning parameters.

    And then I guess just more broadly, again, on the same topic.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you just share a little bit about the process of evaluation with the data center developers and how you </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">structure the contracts and their commitments in terms of having the load show up and so that you&#x27;re restructuring the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">cost profile appropriately to protect ratepayers?</span>
    Robert Blue

Yes, Bill, great question.
    They -- our data centers are on the rate schedule that applies to all our large customers.
    And that&#x27;s been that way for some time.
    And the State Corporation Commission would have to make any changes if we were talking about -- approve any changes 
if we&#x27;re talking about any changes to that, which not on the table at the moment.
    The sort of thinking about the way we structure contracts, they have contract minimum demands that they are 
obligated to achieve in order to cover the incremental cost of the infrastructure that we&#x27;re building for them.
    And that has been in place for us for some time.

    I&#x27;m sure there will be further conversations during the case.
    But I think I can say confidently they understand what we&#x27;re looking to accomplish here and the conversations have 
been very constructive.
    Carly Davenport

Great.
    Appreciate that color.
    And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the earlier question just on your conversations with data center customers.
    Are you seeing any change in tone or concern just around the broader economic uncertainty that we&#x27;ve seen and any 
pause perhaps in some of the new projects that you&#x27;re expecting to move forward?
    Bob Blue

The short answer to that question is no.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re seeing continued appetite for additional data center capacity in our service territory.</span>
    Carly Davenport

Great.
    Thank you for the time.
