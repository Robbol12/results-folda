[Year 2024] contracted data center demand; connected

1. [Sentence #779, D_Q3_2024_transcript] [PLAN]
     We're currently studying approximately 8 gigawatts of data center demand within the substation engineering letters of authorization stage, which means that customers requested the company to begin the necessary engineering for new distribution and substation infrastructure required to serve the customer.
     There are also about 6 gigawatts of data center demand that have executed construction letters of authorization, which are contracts that enable construction of the required distribution and substation electric infrastructure to begin.
     Should customers in this stage elect to discontinue projects, they're obligated to reimburse the company for our investment to date.
     Finally, the 8 gigawatts included in electrical service agreements, or ESA, represent contracts for electric service between Dominion Energy and a customer.
     Each contract is structured for an individual account.
     By signing an ESA, the customer is committing to consuming a certain level of electricity annually, often with ramp schedules where the contracted usage grows over time.
     In aggregate, we have data center demand of over 21 gigawatts as of July 2024, which compares to around 16 gigawatts as of July 2023.
>>> These contracted amounts do not contemplate the many data center projects that are in development phase and have not yet reached a point in the service connection process where a contract is executed.
     Turning to Slide 14, let me update you on our transmission system planning.
     As I've shared previously, the PJM DOM zone is experiencing unprecedented load growth.
     This has resulted in a similarly unprecedented increase in both the quantity and size of delivery point requests for transmission service on our system.
     For context, we've received 63 construction delivery point requests year-to-date September, representing nearly 13 gigawatts of capacity.
     Since 2020, we've received 280 construction delivery point requests, representing nearly 40 gigawatts of capacity.
     We've recently begun implementing changes to our process that will only affect new delivery point requests.
     This will allow us to organize load requests into batches and serve them in the order they're received.

     First, customers' needs.
     We're ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals, plus the very robust demand growth we're observing in real time across our system.
     DEV's weather-normal year-over-year sales growth rate through March was 4.8%, precisely in line with our full year 2024 growth rate expectation of 4.5% to 5.5%, driven by economic growth, electrification and accelerating data center expansion.
     The data center industry has grown substantially in Northern Virginia in recent years.
     In aggregate, we've connected 94 data centers with over 4 gigawatts of capacity over the last approximately 5 years.
     We expect to connect an additional 15 data centers in 2024.
     Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets.
>>> In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude, driven by one, number of data centers requesting to be connected to our system; 2, the size of each facility; and 3, the acceleration of each facility's ramp schedule to reach full capacity.
     For some context, historically, a single data center typically had a demand of 30 megawatts or greater.
     However, we're now receiving individual requests for demand of 60 to 90 megawatts or greater and it hasn't stopped there.
     We get regular requests to support larger data center campuses that include multiple buildings and require total capacity ranging from 300 megawatts to as many as several gigawatts.
     Last month, PJM released its capacity auction planning parameters.
     The results align with our analysis of load growth and the need for requisite dispatchable supply resources included in our 2023 IRP.
     This independent modeling also validates the need to expediently progress the recurring local and PJM regional transmission planning and expansion process and our decision to expedite numerous projects over the last 2 years.
     Second, what are we doing today?

     As I've said before, we're ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals plus the very robust demand growth we're observing in real time across our system.
     This growth has been recognized by third parties.
     As just one example, Virginia was recently named America's top state for business in 2024.
     This was Virginia's record sixth time at the top of CNBC's rankings and its third win in five years, a record unmatched by any other state since the study began in 2007.
     For full-year 2024, we expect DEV sales growth to be between 4.5% to 5.5%, driven by economic growth, electrification and accelerating data center expansion.
     It's worth noting that in July, we registered six new all-time peak demand records and just as we expect, our customers likely had no idea of these demanding load conditions given the high-quality operational performance delivered by our colleagues.
     The data center industry continues to grow in Virginia.
>>> We've connected nine new data centers year-to-date through July, consistent with our expectations to connect 15 data centers in 2024.
     Since 2013, we've averaged around 15 data center connections per year.
     However, growth is accelerating in orders of magnitude, driven by the number of requests, the size of each facility and the acceleration of each facility's ramp schedule to reach full capacity.
     We're taking the steps necessary to ensure our system remains resilient and reliable.
     We had accelerated plans for new 500kv transmission lines and other infrastructure in Northern Virginia, and that remains on track.
     We were awarded over 150 electric transmission projects totaling $2.5 billion during the PJM open window last December.
     PJM's latest open window, which commenced on July 15th is anticipated to be equal to or greater in investment needs as the RTO looks to accommodate data center growth both in Northern Virginia and beyond with additional transmission upgrades.
     We're working expeditiously with PJM, the SCC, local officials and other stakeholders to fast track critical projects.

     In the coming weeks, the final sections of the legs will be set by the crane, as well as overall electrical work to allow for commissioning activities.
     The vessel is currently 93% complete, up from 89% as of our last update.
     We expect completion of Charybdis in early 2025, consistent with our previous guidance range of late '24, early '25.
     The vessel will complete sea trials and then return to port for additional work that will allow it to hold the turbine towers, blades and nacelles.
     There's no change to the vessel's expected availability to support the current CVOW construction schedule, which we anticipate will start in the third quarter next year.
     There's also no change to the vessel's cost of $715 million.
     Moving now to Slide 12.
>>> We continue to see strong data center growth in Virginia and have already connected 14 new data centers year-to-date.
     We now expect to connect 16 data centers in 2024, up from 15 as of our last update.
     Since 2013, we've averaged around 15 data center connections per year.
     Turning to data center demand on Slide 13.
     These contracts are broken into: one, substation engineering letters of authorization; two, construction letters of authorization; and three, electrical service agreements.
     As customers move from one to three, the cost commitment and obligation by the customer increases.
     We're currently studying approximately 8 gigawatts of data center demand within the substation engineering letters of authorization stage, which means that customers requested the company to begin the necessary engineering for new distribution and substation infrastructure required to serve the customer.
     There are also about 6 gigawatts of data center demand that have executed construction letters of authorization, which are contracts that enable construction of the required distribution and substation electric infrastructure to begin.

     So typically, when they had capacity, they might ramp into that capacity over like a 4- to 5-year type of period.
     And now that same capacity that we're interconnecting could be closer to a 2- to 3-year period.
     William Appicelli

Okay.
     That's helpful.
     And then I guess just more broadly, again, on the same topic.
     Can you just share a little bit about the process of evaluation with the data center developers and how you structure the contracts and their commitments in terms of having the load show up and so that you're restructuring the cost profile appropriately to protect ratepayers?
     Robert Blue

Yes, Bill, great question.
>>> They -- our data centers are on the rate schedule that applies to all our large customers.
     And that's been that way for some time.
     And the State Corporation Commission would have to make any changes if we were talking about -- approve any changes if we're talking about any changes to that, which not on the table at the moment.
     The sort of thinking about the way we structure contracts, they have contract minimum demands that they are obligated to achieve in order to cover the incremental cost of the infrastructure that we're building for them.
     And that has been in place for us for some time.

     Being very focused on affordability allows us to ensure customers are getting compelling value, coupled with high reliability.
     Turning to Slide 14 and the growth outlook in Virginia.
     Let me share a few thoughts on, first, our customers' needs; second, what's being done to support them; and third, the impact to our long-term financial plan.
