1. [Sentence #107] [PLAN]
     We're currently studying approximately 8 gigawatts of data center demand within the substation engineering letters of authorization stage, which means that customers requested the company to begin the necessary engineering for new distribution and substation infrastructure required to serve the customer.
     There are also about 6 gigawatts of data center demand that have executed construction letters of authorization, which are contracts that enable construction of the required distribution and substation electric infrastructure to begin.
     Should customers in this stage elect to discontinue projects, they're obligated to reimburse the company for our investment to date.
     Finally, the 8 gigawatts included in electrical service agreements, or ESA, represent contracts for electric service between Dominion Energy and a customer.
     Each contract is structured for an individual account.
     By signing an ESA, the customer is committing to consuming a certain level of electricity annually, often with ramp schedules where the contracted usage grows over time.
     In aggregate, we have data center demand of over 21 gigawatts as of July 2024, which compares to around 16 gigawatts as of July 2023.
>>> These contracted amounts do not contemplate the many data center projects that are in development phase and have not yet reached a point in the service connection process where a contract is executed.
     Turning to Slide 14, let me update you on our transmission system planning.
     As I've shared previously, the PJM DOM zone is experiencing unprecedented load growth.
     This has resulted in a similarly unprecedented increase in both the quantity and size of delivery point requests for transmission service on our system.
     For context, we've received 63 construction delivery point requests year-to-date September, representing nearly 13 gigawatts of capacity.
     Since 2020, we've received 280 construction delivery point requests, representing nearly 40 gigawatts of capacity.
     We've recently begun implementing changes to our process that will only affect new delivery point requests.
     This will allow us to organize load requests into batches and serve them in the order they're received.

     In the coming weeks, the final sections of the legs will be set by the crane, as well as overall electrical work to allow for commissioning activities.
     The vessel is currently 93% complete, up from 89% as of our last update.
     We expect completion of Charybdis in early 2025, consistent with our previous guidance range of late '24, early '25.
     The vessel will complete sea trials and then return to port for additional work that will allow it to hold the turbine towers, blades and nacelles.
     There's no change to the vessel's expected availability to support the current CVOW construction schedule, which we anticipate will start in the third quarter next year.
     There's also no change to the vessel's cost of $715 million.
     Moving now to Slide 12.
>>> We continue to see strong data center growth in Virginia and have already connected 14 new data centers year-to-date.
     We now expect to connect 16 data centers in 2024, up from 15 as of our last update.
     Since 2013, we've averaged around 15 data center connections per year.

     These contracts are broken into: one, substation engineering letters of authorization; two, construction letters of authorization; and three, electrical service agreements.
     As customers move from one to three, the cost commitment and obligation by the customer increases.
