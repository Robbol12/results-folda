[D_Q1_2024_transcript [Transcript]] contracted data center demand; connected

1. [Sentence #155] [PLAN]
     First, customers' needs.
     We're ramping into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals, plus the very robust demand growth we're observing in real time across our system.
     DEV's weather-normal year-over-year sales growth rate through March was 4.8%, precisely in line with our full year 2024 growth rate expectation of 4.5% to 5.5%, driven by economic growth, electrification and accelerating data center expansion.
     The data center industry has grown substantially in Northern Virginia in recent years.
     In aggregate, we've connected 94 data centers with over 4 gigawatts of capacity over the last approximately 5 years.
     We expect to connect an additional 15 data centers in 2024.
     Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets.
>>> In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude, driven by one, number of data centers requesting to be connected to our system; 2, the size of each facility; and 3, the acceleration of each facility's ramp schedule to reach full capacity.
     For some context, historically, a single data center typically had a demand of 30 megawatts or greater.
     However, we're now receiving individual requests for demand of 60 to 90 megawatts or greater and it hasn't stopped there.
     We get regular requests to support larger data center campuses that include multiple buildings and require total capacity ranging from 300 megawatts to as many as several gigawatts.
     Last month, PJM released its capacity auction planning parameters.
     The results align with our analysis of load growth and the need for requisite dispatchable supply resources included in our 2023 IRP.
     This independent modeling also validates the need to expediently progress the recurring local and PJM regional transmission planning and expansion process and our decision to expedite numerous projects over the last 2 years.
     Second, what are we doing today?

2. [Sentence #336] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So typically, when they had capacity, they might ramp into that capacity over like a 4- to 5-year type of period.
     And now that same capacity that we're interconnecting could be closer to a 2- to 3-year period.
     William Appicelli

Okay.
     That's helpful.
     And then I guess just more broadly, again, on the same topic.
     Can you just share a little bit about the process of evaluation with the data center developers and how you structure the contracts and their commitments in terms of having the load show up and so that you're restructuring the cost profile appropriately to protect ratepayers?
     Robert Blue

Yes, Bill, great question.
>>> They -- our data centers are on the rate schedule that applies to all our large customers.
     And that's been that way for some time.
     And the State Corporation Commission would have to make any changes if we were talking about -- approve any changes if we're talking about any changes to that, which not on the table at the moment.
     The sort of thinking about the way we structure contracts, they have contract minimum demands that they are obligated to achieve in order to cover the incremental cost of the infrastructure that we're building for them.
     And that has been in place for us for some time.

3. [Sentence #152] [PLAN]
     Being very focused on affordability allows us to ensure customers are getting compelling value, coupled with high reliability.
     Turning to Slide 14 and the growth outlook in Virginia.
     Let me share a few thoughts on, first, our customers' needs; second, what's being done to support them; and third, the impact to our long-term financial plan.

     I mean is there, I guess, a historical precedent of how long it's taken on prior data centers?
     Diane Leopold

This is Diane Leopold again.
