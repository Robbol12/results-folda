[D_Q1_2025_transcript [Transcript]] contracted data center demand; connected

1. [Sentence #30] [PLAN]
     Turning to our financing plan as shown on Slide 4.
     We've sold approximately $1 billion of forward-settled common equity under our existing ATM program at a weighted average price of approximately $57 and expect to complete $200 million of DRIP-related equity issuance by year-end.
     This is consistent with our 2025 common equity guidance.
     We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs in the context of our sizable growth capital spending program as appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for our strong credit ratings category.
     We remain focused on balance sheet conservatism and there is no change to our previously communicated credit-related targets.
     Turning briefly to data centers.
     As a reminder from our fourth quarter update, we have approximately 40 gigawatts of data center capacity in various stages of contracting, including what is now approximately 10 gigawatts of capacity contracted under electric service agreements.
>>> Since our last call, we have not observed any evidence of slowing demand from data center customers across our service area.
     In conclusion, I'll reiterate that I'm highly confident in our ability to deliver on our financial plan.
     The financial guidance has been built to be appropriately but also not unreasonably conservative to weather unforeseen challenges that may come our way.
     With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
     Bob Blue

Thank you, Stephen.
     Turning to safety performance.
     Our Dominion Energy family experienced tragedy on March 31, when Ryan Barwick, a material fuel handler at Wateree Station in Eastover South Carolina, died after being severely injured while unloading a railcar.
     We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dedicated colleague, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with his family, friends, coworkers and community.

3. [Sentence #298] [PLAN]
     I'm sure there will be further conversations during the case.
     But I think I can say confidently they understand what we're looking to accomplish here and the conversations have been very constructive.
     Carly Davenport

Great.
     Appreciate that color.
     And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the earlier question just on your conversations with data center customers.
     Are you seeing any change in tone or concern just around the broader economic uncertainty that we've seen and any pause perhaps in some of the new projects that you're expecting to move forward?
     Bob Blue

The short answer to that question is no.
>>> We're seeing continued appetite for additional data center capacity in our service territory.
     Carly Davenport

Great.
     Thank you for the time.
     Operator

We'll take our next question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.
     Please go ahead.
     Your line is open.
     Anthony Crowdell

Hey, good morning team.
     Just two quick questions.
