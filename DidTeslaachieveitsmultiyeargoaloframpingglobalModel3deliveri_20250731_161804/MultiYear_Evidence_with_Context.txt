[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #66, TSLA_Q1_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
     We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
>>> And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.

     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
     This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
>>> Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping two major products.
     What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviously learned a lot here.
     After the Model 3 ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
     In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
     Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
     Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.

3. [Sentence #33, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PILOT]
     Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.
     Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
     Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to proceed.
     I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
     We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at this point.
     This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
     Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month.
>>> All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
     Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive and making them better and better.
     I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined.
     I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
     Itâ€™s the reason I say it's very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is training Google all the time with their searches.
     So, when you're searching something and you click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that.
     It's very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
     So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be able to drive through an intersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns.

4. [Sentence #169, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
     That's it.
     Effortless.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And many customers do that.
     Elon Musk

And they're doing it, yes.
     In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this is something you can do, because normally, buying a car is quite a pain -- for most people, they would rather go to the dentist than buy a new car.
>>> Actually, my dentist is very -- but it's really like quite an arduous thing.
     When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or something on Amazon and -- except it's a car.
     Yes.
     All right.
     And then five minutes is a, if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probably in 90 seconds, so.
     Martin Viecha

The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of the Battery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve cell energy density and time line for introduction?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Actually, we were just -- we don't want to preempt Battery Day.

5. [Sentence #168, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we've been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.

7. [Sentence #313, TSLA_Q2_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Different conversations.
     Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
     Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
     I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     It's a fair question.
     I don't have any additional color to provide.
>>> So $8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we're managing it very closely.
     As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the end of Q1.
     So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
     And as we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months, and there's ups and downs to the liquidity.
     Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we're paying off.
     But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and then we'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in.
     So it does go up and down a little bit.
     But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we're managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company.
-----
8. [Sentence #200, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
     So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
     And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of the year, as a subscription.
     So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
     That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
>>> Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
     Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
     Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years?
     This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
     Is 40% or more realistic target?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people â€“ actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
-----
9. [Sentence #127, TSLA_Q2_2020] [PLAN]
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is â€“ will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.
     So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront.
     And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
     Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
     At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
     That is our goal.
>>> And we think that, that's the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.
     And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty â€“ the guest loyalty.
     So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident that if we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
     To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so they can qualify for the subsidy?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
-----
10. [Sentence #135, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     And it's what results in long-term value creation and loyalty â€“ the guest loyalty.

     Elon Musk

Yes.
     So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
>>> And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3 basically tomorrow, China time.
     So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
     And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
     And we feel confident that that's will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
     So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
     And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's not complete, and there's additional opportunities there.

11. [Sentence #209, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people â€“ actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
     So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number.
>>> It's possible that is 40%.
     I would be very shocked, if it's less than 40%, even with force majeure Model 3.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question from retail investors.
     When will you announce the next Giga?
     How many Gigas, do you have planned for the next five years?
     Elon Musk

I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
     We may not â€“ as soon as next month.
-----
12. [Sentence #164, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     The other one that I would add is, it's always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Touchless delivery.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
     Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we've been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.

     Actually, my dentist is very -- but it's really like quite an arduous thing.
     When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to people than having a root canal done, then you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy as ordering something from the Apple App Store or something on Amazon and -- except it's a car.

     So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading-edge Alpha [indiscernible] driving the car.
     So let's see.
     On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X.

15. [Sentence #80, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
     A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
     We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly ahead of schedule.
     This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
     It's hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.
     Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in Fremont.
     This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early February.
>>> We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
     We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
     Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
     We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.

     We may not â€“ as soon as next month.
     This is not a prediction, just saying.

     So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind of thing, when those eventually come back.
     Those are extra hard cases.
     But it's all tracking very well.
     If you like, the water pallets engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I'm deeply involved with the team.
     So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
     So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we're headed.
     And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have the functionality thatâ€™s really cool, also driving by the end of the year.
>>> Now after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.
     And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
     And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.
     And then presumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous cars that can drive with no human onboard.
     Obviously, the regulatory approval process that's difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because it's out of our hands.
     But for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.
     Gene Munster

So, to summarize, we want -- we're going to give owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year.
     Then a human is in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year?

     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
     Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
     While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
>>> More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
     Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
     The Tesla team has done a great job here.
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.
     It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
     And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
     So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.

     And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done great work as -- at the Japan Pension Fund, which is the largest fund of any kind in the world.
     And generally, the conversations over the years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the global security markets work and what he thinks it is, whether are historical.
     It just -- it seems like he has a strong philosophical understanding about how to make the future better.
     And he shares our view regarding the environment and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people.
     Ben Kallo

I guess leaking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going?
     And is there any read-through on bringing him on to the Board?
     Thank you.
>>> Elon Musk

No.
     I think this is set right through with the Panasonic relationship.
     I mean, I have a great relationship with Panasonic's CEO.
     We meet regularly one on one and talk at the time.
     So, that relationship is strong.
     Just that he'd bring more of a broader and a global, strategic view to the Board.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question, please.

     And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
     It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
     So -- and the feedback we're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.
     We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
     So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when they will let us continue.
     Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over time.
     While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
>>> We're absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
     And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
     So there's a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now to Zach's opening remarks.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.

26. [Sentence #353, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     It's a question of will.
     Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it?
     So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation of the past.
     If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
     Obviously thatâ€™s not steam engines.
     So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people's rights, as what is happening right now.
     I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if somebody wants to stay in their house, that's great.
>>> They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.
     But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
     This is not democratic.
     This is not freedom.
     Give people back their goddamn freedom.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's go to the next question please.
     Operator

Thank you.

27. [Sentence #303, TSLA_Q4_2019] [UNCERTAIN]
     Our first question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
     Please go ahead.
     Adam Jonas

Thanks everybody.
     I hope everyone's safe and healthy.
     I got one question, one follow-up.
     And I'd point out, I've had a root canal before, and I would agree, Elon.
     It was less painful than buying a car.
>>> Elon Musk

I mean, really, it's -- yeah, exactly.
     Adam Jonas

It's a big problem, actually.
     It's a big problem.
     Different conversations.
     Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
     Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
     I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.

28. [Sentence #270, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PILOT]
     They're not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal car.
     And we're continuing to improve the filters on 3 and Y.
     These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
     It's reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
     So it's really â€“ air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
     So taking all those things that we've replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is just very exciting.
     And then you've got â€“ if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
>>> Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other way around.
     So lots of options.
     Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
     So we just have to â€“ Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
     So we're going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof andâ€¦

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.

29. [Sentence #157, TSLA_Q3_2021] [UNCERTAIN]
     And we've talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
     So I think that there's clearly an uncertain future ahead.
     It's a bit of a bumpy road.
     But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
     Anything you guys want to add?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
     The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think is great.
>>> The other one that I would add is, it's always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Touchless delivery.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
     Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we've been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.
     That's it.

     We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.
     On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the end of Q4.
     In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
     Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
     Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
     We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
     Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
>>> We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overall profitability.
     As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally increase with time.
     This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
     And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accounts receivable on the balance sheet.
     Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary â€“ by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
     Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash flows.
     As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology road map.
     We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
