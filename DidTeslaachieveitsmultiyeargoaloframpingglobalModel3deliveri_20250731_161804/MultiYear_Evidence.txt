[Multi-Year Analysis] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #20]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the ****North** **America**** market and to introduce **Model** Y to **Europe**.
2. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching ****Model** 3** last quarter and achieving the first **deliveries** earlier this year.
3. [Sentence #24]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) It’s been exceeded by the Tesla ****Model** 3**, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
4. [Sentence #24]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) It’s been exceeded by the Tesla ****Model** 3**, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
5. [Sentence #28]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We ramped the ****Model** 3** in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
6. [Sentence #33]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) And we'll be doing ****Model** 3** and Y for the eastern half of ****North** **America****.
7. [Sentence #35]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) But we expect California to do **Model** S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of ****North** **America****.
8. [Sentence #37]  (TSLA_Q3_2024) So, I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680 -- we'll have the -- the Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost competitive cell in ****North** **America****, a testament to the tremendous amount of hard work there done by the team.
9. [Sentence #65]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This year for the Shanghai built ****Model** 3**, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
10. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly **global** manufacturer with major factories in ****North** **America****, **China** and **Europe** and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
11. [Sentence #74]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Additionally, we are in the process of **ramping** two major products ****Model** 3** in Shanghai and **Model** Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
12. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We also announced a long-range and performance variant of ****Model** 3** for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in **China**.
13. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still **ramping** Cybertruck and ****Model** 3** and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
14. [Sentence #87]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in ****North** **America**** on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
15. [Sentence #103]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) What is the time line for localizing the ****Model** 3** in **Europe**, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
16. [Sentence #127]  (TSLA_Q2_2020) The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term **goal** of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond ****Model** 3**, Y and the Cybertruck?
17. [Sentence #135]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range ****Model** 3** basically tomorrow, **China** time.
18. [Sentence #157]  (TSLA_Q3_2021) And so, we saw an uptick primarily in **Europe** and ****North** **America**** and service wait times over the course of the summer.
19. [Sentence #164]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of ****Model** 3** in **China** relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
20. [Sentence #168]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in **China**, ****North** **America**** and **Europe**.
21. [Sentence #169]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in **China**, a factory in California, a factory -- ****North** **America**** factory in **Europe**.
22. [Sentence #200]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in ****North** **America****.
23. [Sentence #209]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The first one began with the **global** expansion of ****Model** 3** and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.
24. [Sentence #210]  (TSLA_Q3_2022) Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in ****North** **America****, as Elon also mentioned.
25. [Sentence #270]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure ****Model** 3** or **Model** Y cars.
26. [Sentence #303]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, ****Model** 3** is expanding as **Model** Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
27. [Sentence #313]  (TSLA_Q2_2024) We're still importing **Model** 3s into **Europe**, out of Shanghai.
28. [Sentence #353]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So I mean, relative to the current ****Model** 3**, **China** **Model** 2 pricing is slightly lower.
29. [Sentence #426]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) But I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in **America** by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in **America** next year, at everywhere in ****North** **America****, at least.
30. [Sentence #459]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) So we're going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in ****North** **America**** and **China** over the coming quarters.
