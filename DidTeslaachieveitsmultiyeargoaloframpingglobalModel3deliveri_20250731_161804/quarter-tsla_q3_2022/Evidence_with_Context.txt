[TSLA_Q3_2022] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #200] [PLAN]
     And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
     I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
     It’s not a number.
     It’s [indiscernible] table.
     You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
     And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
     As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
>>> So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.
     And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
     And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
     So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?
     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?

     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
     Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter.
>>> Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.
     On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
     And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.

3. [Sentence #263] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
     It will be smaller, to be clear.
     But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
     I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.
     But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.
     So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.
     It’s like, we’re going to take two.
>>> That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Effort costs.
     Elon Musk

Yes…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
     Elon Musk

We’re twice the output.
     And we do believe this can be done.
     By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn’t including Optimus.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

5. [Sentence #33] [PILOT]
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
>>> So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
     So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.
-----
6. [Sentence #132] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
-----
7. [Sentence #119] [PLAN]
     We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
     Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
     Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let’s go to the next question.
     The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly.
     And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
>>> The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
     Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
     But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.
     In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

8. [Sentence #218] [UNCERTAIN]
     On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
     And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.
>>> And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
     Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
     Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
     Unidentified Company Representative

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.
     The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more.
     And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.

9. [Sentence #182] [PLAN]
     Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
     Martin Viecha

Right.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Of course.
     There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
     So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
     I’ll be there in person.
>>> And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
     That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range.
     Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo.
     Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground.
     Yes, sure.
     Not up.
