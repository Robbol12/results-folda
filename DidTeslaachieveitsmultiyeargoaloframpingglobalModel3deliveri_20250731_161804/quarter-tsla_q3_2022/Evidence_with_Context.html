America, Europe, and China?

    And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look 
at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
    I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
    It’s not a number.
    It’s  table.
    You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
    And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
    As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> units in </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4"> for Tesla Semi in North </span>
<span class="r4">America.</span>
    And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
    And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
    So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.

Thank you.
    The next question is, what is the progress of the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell ramp?
    And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
    Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> car cells per week this 
quarter, as we said last quarter.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our focus is now shifting from </span><span class="r4">100</span><span class="r4">% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon</span>
<span class="r4">also mentioned.</span>
    On the <span class="r2">2170</span> versus <span class="r2">4680</span>, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover 
while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
    And that sort of mix is going to shift as <span class="r2">4680</span> scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
    Elon Musk

Right.
    Basically, production of <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp is growing exponentially.
    And yes, it’s going well.
    We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

<span class="r7">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r7">]</span>

Elon Musk

Yes.

<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">263</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about
the cost of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y platform.
    It will be smaller, to be clear.
    But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
    I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into 
that platform.
    But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a <span class="r2">2</span>-for-<span class="r2">1</span> target.
    So, we’re trying to get to that <span class="r2">50</span>% number again.
    It’s like, we’re going to take two.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; That’s exactly what  how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Effort costs.
    Elon Musk

Yes…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
    Elon Musk

We’re twice the output.
    And we do believe this can be done.
    By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult 
path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much 
as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn’t including Optimus.

    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span class="r2">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span class="r7">(</span>ph<span class="r7">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.</span>
    So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program 
this year, probably about a month from now.
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
    Let’s see, with respect to demand.
    We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
    I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far 
into future as we can see.
    So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins 
strong.

<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">132</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r2">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r4">a </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">119</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year.
    Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well 
positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
    Elon Musk

Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly 
possible to get to <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially 
outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”

Elon Musk

Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- 
simply from a property market mostly.
    And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more</span>
<span class="r4">than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.</span>
    Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
    But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle 
production, sales deliveries by -- on average <span class="r2">50</span>% a year as far into the future as we can see.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by <span class="r2">50</span>% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out
the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.
    In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there 
weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.

    Unidentified Company Representative

We need to get <span class="r2">300</span> to <span class="r2">400</span> terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is <span class="r2">300</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>
to <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt hours or <span class="r2">300</span> to <span class="r2">400</span> terawatt hours.

So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high 
tonnage and then some nickel.
    The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, 
maybe more.
    And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
