[TSLA_Q3_2020] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #125] [PLAN]
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
>>> While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.

     Operator

Thank you.
     Our next question will come from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.
     Please go ahead.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you.
     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
>>> Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.

     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
     With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
     Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
     Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
>>> But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
     It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target as Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
     But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
     And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont and S and X margins.
     So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     Thanks.
     And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.

     So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.
     That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
     Then in terms of capacity build out.
     We're making progress on three major factories.
     We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team.
     It is just, I mean, incredibly good.
     Super smart, work hard.
>>> It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.
     It's beyond all reasonable expectations.
     And then we're under construction in Berlin and Austin.
     So we're also making good progress there.
     Yes.
     It’s good.
     So it’s overall going well.
     I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year.

     So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then train against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.
     And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
     There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.
     So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.

     Thanks.
     And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
     And I think your strategy generally has been, you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate the extra volume.
