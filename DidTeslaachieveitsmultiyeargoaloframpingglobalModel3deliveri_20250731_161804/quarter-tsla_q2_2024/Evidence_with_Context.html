    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff 
side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being 
imported from China into Europe.
    While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second 
round.
    They visited our factory.
    They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.
    As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe.
    But -- and one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right hand from model wise out of Berlin and
we also delivered it in U.K. And we&#x27;re adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjust.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re still importing Model 3s into Europe, out of Shanghai.</span>
    And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate manage all this just on the examination by the European 
authorities.
    Like I said, we cooperated with them.
    Well, we are confident that they, we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now.
    But this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this.
    It is -- I would also add that, because of this, you&#x27;ve seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into 
places like Taiwan as well as, U.K I just mentioned.
    So it will keep changing and we will keep adapting as we go about it.

    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r2">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping </span>
<span class="r4">Cybertruck and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished </span>
<span class="r4">goods.</span>
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.

    So if you&#x27;re rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new earth.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind </span>
<span class="r4">that in, in North America.</span>
    So with the -- with Version <span class="r2">12.5</span>, and maybe a <span class="r2">12.6</span>, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of 
the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span class="r2">50</span> states, reasonably.

    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.

    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span class="r2">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span class="r2">2</span> of Optimus.
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should </span>
<span class="r4">roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.</span>
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
    Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the 
fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span class="r2">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you feel you&#x27;re cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?
    Elon Musk

We are doing some advertising, so, want to say something?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I would say something.
    Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who </span>
<span class="r4">had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging.</span>
    We&#x27;ve spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy.
    We&#x27;re not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our 
options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we&#x27;ll move on to the next 
one.
    What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.

    These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter.
    These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs.
    We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world.

    You&#x27;ve leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense.
    But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of 
tariffs in Europe.
