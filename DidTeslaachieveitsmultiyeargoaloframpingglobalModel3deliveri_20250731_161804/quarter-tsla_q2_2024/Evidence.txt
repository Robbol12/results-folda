--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #49]  So we are **ramping** up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in **China** that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
2. [Sentence #73]  We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in **Europe** and **China** as well for the respective factories.
3. [Sentence #77]  Since the revision of FSD pricing in ****North** **America****, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
