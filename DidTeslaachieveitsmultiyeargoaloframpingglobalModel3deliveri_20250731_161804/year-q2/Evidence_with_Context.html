America, Europe, and China?

    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
    And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll be doing Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Y for the eastern half of North America.</span>
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff 
side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being 
imported from China into Europe.
    While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second 
round.
    They visited our factory.
    They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information.
    As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe.
    But -- and one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right hand from model wise out of Berlin and
we also delivered it in U.K. And we&#x27;re adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjust.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re still importing Model 3s into Europe, out of Shanghai.</span>
    And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate manage all this just on the examination by the European 
authorities.
    Like I said, we cooperated with them.
    Well, we are confident that they, we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now.
    But this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this.
    It is -- I would also add that, because of this, you&#x27;ve seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into 
places like Taiwan as well as, U.K I just mentioned.
    So it will keep changing and we will keep adapting as we go about it.
    Dan Levy

    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span class="r2">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span class="r4">20</span><span class="r4"> million units </span>
<span class="r4">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span class="r4">beyond Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">629</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2021]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So Q1 <span class="r2">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span class="r2">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span class="r2">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two </span>
<span class="r4">factories.</span>
    For Model <span class="r2">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span class="r2">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span class="r2">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span class="r2">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span class="r2">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.
    Let&#x27;s see, is there anything more I want to say about?
    There&#x27;s a lot of information.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2341</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r2">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping </span>
<span class="r4">Cybertruck and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished </span>
<span class="r4">goods.</span>
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">348</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    It will be just awesome.
    Yes.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And there’s like two general classes of cell.
    There&#x27;s like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer 
range.
    Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack 
you have to subtract in cargo.
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive </span>
<span class="r4">coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total </span>
<span class="r4">vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron </span>
<span class="r4">phosphate battery pack in Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.</span>
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard <span class="r2">3</span> Range version of Model Y.
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r2">20</span> years of 
recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
    On the residential side, we have some fun things happening.
    We recently surpassed <span class="r2">0.5</span> million Powerwalls installed.
    Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their
vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof.
    Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support 
to ERCOT.
    We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over 
time as ERCOT expands market access.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle </span>
<span class="r4">customers over the rest of the quarter.</span>
    Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers
requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
    In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access 
that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.
    For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system 
buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing 
incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

All right.
    I can take that.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So if you&#x27;re rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new earth.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind </span>
<span class="r4">that in, in North America.</span>
    So with the -- with Version <span class="r2">12.5</span>, and maybe a <span class="r2">12.6</span>, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of 
the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span class="r2">50</span> states, reasonably.

    On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability.
    This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and
field operations around the world.
    To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to

    The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost 
savings actions.
    Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.
    On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from <span class="r2">20</span>% to <span class="r2">18.7</span>%.
    This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the 
various shutdowns.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and </span>
<span class="r4">Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai.</span>
    Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the 
world on some of our products.
    With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $<span class="r2">48</span> million of deferred revenue 
in the period.
    The full profit impact on our P&amp;L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in 
the field.
    Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $<span class="r2">428</span> million.
    While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of <span class="r2">2020</span> credit revenue is roughly double that of <span class="r2">2019</span>.
    Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.
    In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">631</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2021]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span class="r2">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span class="r2">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span class="r2">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span class="r2">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $</span><span class="r4">0.25</span><span class="r4"> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized</span>
<span class="r4">rate of $</span><span class="r4">0.5</span><span class="r4"> million per year.</span>
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span class="r2">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span class="r2">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.
    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span class="r2">70</span> watts or <span class="r2">80</span> watts.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">15</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1763</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just </span>
<span class="r4">as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just </span>
<span class="r4">making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car </span>
<span class="r4">companies.</span>
    And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">16</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2310</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span class="r2">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span class="r2">2</span> of Optimus.
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should </span>
<span class="r4">roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.</span>
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
    Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the 
fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
    And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
    ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $<span class="r2">5</span> trillion, I think they are probably not wrong.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">17</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1087</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2021]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned.
    We are also getting very heavy into <span class="r2">4680</span> development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural
battery pack that goes along with that.
    And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry.
    And so we are investing heavily there on an R&amp;D side to work out those kinks.
    And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of 
those.
    Then I also mentioned, and Elon talked a bit about, Dojo and the potential there.
    So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make 
investments in.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the SG&amp;A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global and China is ramping quite quickly.</span>
    And we are trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume, so that we have the right sales capacity, 
store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the 
execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we have seen in the past and so we are 
making investments there ahead of the growth.
    And overall, as we look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we do expect to see a 
substantial drop from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2021</span> as the volumes in the latter part of the year pick up.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question, please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    We have Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
    Your line is open.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">18</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1106</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2021]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">19</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">498</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    I mean, it&#x27;s worth telling that we&#x27;re -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received <span class="r2">0</span> federal tax credit.
    Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $<span class="r2">7</span>,<span class="r2">500</span> pack tax credit.
    And yet our sales have continued to do well.
    Yes.
    Zach Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars.
    That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.</span>
    You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, 
particularly full self-driving, there&#x27;s the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will 
expand as we release more features.
    And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network.
    Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.
    There&#x27;s still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the 
company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them.
    So we continue to see efficiencies there.
    So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level.
    And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">20</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">450</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Just to start with the gross margin questions.
    We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken.
    The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp.
    So we think there&#x27;s think there&#x27;s a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there.
    Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production.
    And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the 
Model Y margin.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> cost structure will converge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model <span class="r2">3</span>, and it&#x27;s not yet at full production.
    And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative 
gross margins.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory.
    And it&#x27;s continuing to do more and more internally.
    But it&#x27;s also -- the thing that&#x27;s really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in 
other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">21</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1759</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2023]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.

other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world.
    And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle.
    And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like <span class="r2">5</span>% to <span class="r2">10</span>% a month, from <span class="r2">40</span> -- it was 
like <span class="r2">40</span>% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like <span class="r2">80</span>% by the end of this year, maybe more.

    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or 
significantly safer than human.
    We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability.
    It&#x27;s difficult to argue with if you -- if you&#x27;ve got a large number of -- yes, if you&#x27;ve got billions of miles that 
show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human.
    What regulator could really stand in the way of that?
    They would -- they&#x27;re morally obligated to approve.
    So I don&#x27;t think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
    I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind 
that in, in North America.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So with the -- with Version </span><span class="r4">12.5</span><span class="r4">, and maybe a </span><span class="r4">12.6</span><span class="r4">, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of </span>
<span class="r4">the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries.</span>
    And I, I think we&#x27;re likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in 
those regions obviously.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    Just to …

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Travis.
    Travis Axelrod

In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is 
the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    The road rules are the same across all <span class="r2">50</span> states.
    So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all <span class="r2">50</span> states, reasonably.
    Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation 
company or deploying taxes.

    And finally, despite losing more builds in Q3 than expected, we are still pushing to reach <span class="r2">50</span>% growth this year.
    This target has become more difficult, but it remains possible with strong execution and as Elon mentioned, no more 
force majeure events for the balance of the year.

Yes, a lot of force majeure in the last several years, that’s for sure.

    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to the questions from investors.
    And the first question is, Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job than their Western competitors, 
excluding Tesla, at innovating in software and design.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; How can Tesla make sure the company is staying ahead of those manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, the – right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla  <span class="r8">(</span>ph<span class="r8">)</span>.
    We are actually doing the best, thanks to our incredible team in China.
    But I have a lot of respect for the Chinese, our manufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular.
    I think they will be a force to be reckoned with worldwide.
    They are very – they are smart and they are hardworking.
    And I think anyone who is not – any company that’s not as competitive as them will obviously suffer a market share 
decline.
    So obviously, we have a lot of respect for the current companies in China and then their capabilities, yes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">354</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    So it&#x27;s very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries.
    What we&#x27;re seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive 
coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total 
vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model <span class="r2">3</span>, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron 
phosphate battery pack in Model <span class="r2">3</span> in China and that that&#x27;ll be in volume production later this year.
    So, we think that getting a range that is in the high <span class="r2">200</span> -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of 
almost <span class="r2">300</span> miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle 
efficiencies.
    And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy 
density.
    So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel.
    We use very little cobalt in our system already and that&#x27;s -- that may to zero along, so it&#x27;s basically about 
nickel.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> Range version of Model Y.</span>
    No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.
    Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past?
    What are the biggest constraints now?
    Elon Musk

Well, I&#x27;d just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel.
    Okay.
    Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don&#x27;t wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some 
high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency.
    As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it’s just staying on the ground and so I
think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, 
technically.
    But the phosphate part is unnecessary.
    It’s really just the iron or nickel.
    I am assuming the terminology.
    Just think of it as iron and nickel and there’s an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could have 
possibly used and there’s also more lithium than we could possibly use.
    Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium-ion cells.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors which is, you have suggested that between a 5x to 1</span><span class="r4">0x</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">improvement is achievable in automotive production versus the first Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> line on a first-principles physics analysis.</span>
    Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?
    Elon Musk

I think we are still quite far away from it.
    I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is for those who have never done production, they just don’t 
understand how insanely hard production is.
    I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
    Prototypes are trivial.
    They are child’s play.
    Production is hard.

    So it would use any accessories that a human would use.
    Yes.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you feel you&#x27;re cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?
    Elon Musk

We are doing some advertising, so, want to say something?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I would say something.
    Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who </span>
<span class="r4">had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging.</span>
    We&#x27;ve spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy.
    We&#x27;re not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our 
options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we&#x27;ll move on to the next 
one.
    What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
    Elon Musk

Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Or maybe play games and do work.
    That&#x27;s in the future.
    We&#x27;re already putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, we have been experimenting on that.
    So, FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity in the near-term.
    But we&#x27;re putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right.
    So, premium connectivity subscription is something that we&#x27;ve put in place.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard </span>
<span class="r4">Range Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats.</span>
    So, these are things that we have and we&#x27;re continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can 
launch and we&#x27;ll trickle those in with time.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But they&#x27;re all very tiny compared with like the step change to full self-driving depending upon how you calculate 
it is probably worth at least $<span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> per car.
    So, it&#x27;s a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The third question is also about Autopilot.
    What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">29</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2334</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2024]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter.
    These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs.
    We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world.
    This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car.
    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further </span>
<span class="r4">localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.</span>
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r2">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
    Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping 
Cybertruck and Model <span class="r2">3</span> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished 
goods.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">30</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">680</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q2_2021]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other 
products.
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
