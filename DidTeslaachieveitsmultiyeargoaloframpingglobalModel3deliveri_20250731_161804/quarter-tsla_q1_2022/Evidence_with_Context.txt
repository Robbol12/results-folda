[TSLA_Q1_2022] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #103] [PLAN]
     So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate of improvement with every release.
     And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
     And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
     But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
     So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
>>> What is the time line for localizing the Model 3 in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
     Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
     And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of production.
     But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
     So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
     So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
     But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
     But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.

2. [Sentence #309] [PLAN]
     And to Elon’s point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable nature of our part arrivals, and our supply chain team, in particular, production planning portion of supply chain.
     We often get very little notice when there’s part shortage is coming, and it’s kind of a scramble couple of days before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here.
     And so, the amount of Herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that is absolutely immense.
     Elon Musk

There’s a saying in the military, it’s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it comes to war.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about previously on raw materials, commodities.
     Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring those costs down.
>>> Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of Model 3 way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market.
     And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
     Prices are higher for all other automakers.
     We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price of the vehicles.
     And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.
     So, it’s one of the points.
     But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the progression of prices over time?
     Elon Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.

     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let’s go to the next question.
     Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     We’re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all the commodity costs.
     So, that’s an exception I needed to call out.
>>> Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve discussed is achieved.
     Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial 4680 and structural battery ramps.
     And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and higher-range structural pack provisions.
     Elon Musk

I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will be competitive with the best alternatives later this year.
     And we think we’ll exceed the best alternatives next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     I mean we have some good existing proofs, right?
     Like we’ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.

4. [Sentence #497] [PILOT]
     Good afternoon.
     And thank you very much for taking the questions.
     I was hoping you could comment on your latest thoughts about potentially opening up the charging network in the U.S. to non-Tesla orders.
     I mean, certainly really important to have a good experience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times and charge installs.
     But Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy a Tesla vehicles in the future.
     Andrew Baglino

Yes.
     As Elon has said and as we’ve publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-party vehicle access in all over the world, not just in Europe, where our original pilot was.
>>> And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being different than others, but we are moving in that direction.
     I don’t know if you want to add.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think that’s -- there’s nothing more to be said on that, but we’re -- yes, we want to do the right thing with respect to the whole system.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
     With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger capacity is really important.
     And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     Mark Delaney

Okay.

5. [Sentence #112] [PLAN]
     And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of production.
     But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
     So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
     So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
     But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
     But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.
     So, it seems likely that we’ll be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year is my -- that’s my best guess.
>>> And then, Model 3.
     It’s important for new factories to be focused on -- and have the least amount of complexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y. It’s -- from the point in which you have a factory complete and you’re making a small number of units to the point where it’s producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start of production.
     So, now hopefully, we’re getting better at that ramp, so maybe it’s a little less.
     But to get to sort of the 5,000 a week level has typically taken us around 12 months from start of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughly in percentage of cost of goods sold for example, in a given quarter versus one to two years out, both direct and indirect?
     Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing higher mix vehicles going forward?
     Elon Musk

Actually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we’re being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles, given that we had record profitability this quarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long.
-----
6. [Sentence #48] [UNCERTAIN]
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great first quarter.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Elon has some opening remarks as well.
     Elon Musk

Sure.
     Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach’s, but it’s maybe worth repeating.
     Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels, by reaching the highest deliveries, profit and an operating margin of 19%.
     This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and an overall difficult quarter.
>>> So, I’d really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output despite many, many difficult headwinds, and especially the Tesla China team in our Shanghai factory.
     They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown and nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles.
     And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.
     So, as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus ‘21.
     I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
     So, let’s see.
     Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
     So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
