America, Europe, and China?

    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in</span>
<span class="r5">North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> million units a year.</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.

    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r5">3</span>
<span class="r5">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.

    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> for our road map, which will positively impact </span>
<span class="r5">ASPs in China.</span>
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.

ASPs in China.

    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.

    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>
<span class="r5">in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai.</span>
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">380</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r2">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> as well, and so we have experience with</span>
<span class="r5">that both with Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.</span>
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?
    Elon Musk

Well, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; After the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.</span>
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.

    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in

    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">10</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">57</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and just despite </span>
<span class="r5">being a bigger car that weighs more.</span>
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
