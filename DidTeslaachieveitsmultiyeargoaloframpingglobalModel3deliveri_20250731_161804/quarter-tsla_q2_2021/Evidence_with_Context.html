    So Q1 <span class="r2">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span class="r2">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span class="r2">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two </span>
<span class="r5">factories.</span>
    For Model <span class="r2">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span class="r2">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span class="r2">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span class="r2">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span class="r2">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.

    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span class="r2">70</span> watts or <span class="r2">80</span> watts.

    And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned.
    We are also getting very heavy into <span class="r2">4680</span> development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural
battery pack that goes along with that.
    And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry.
    And so we are investing heavily there on an R&amp;D side to work out those kinks.
    And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of 
those.
    Then I also mentioned, and Elon talked a bit about, Dojo and the potential there.
    So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make 
investments in.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the SG&amp;A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global and China is ramping quite quickly.</span>
    And we are trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume, so that we have the right sales capacity, 
store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the 
execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we have seen in the past and so we are 
making investments there ahead of the growth.
    And overall, as we look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we do expect to see a 
substantial drop from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2021</span> as the volumes in the latter part of the year pick up.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question, please.

Thank you.
    We have Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
    Your line is open.

    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.

    However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it’s just staying on the ground and so I
think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cells with an iron phosphate cathode, 
technically.
    But the phosphate part is unnecessary.
    It’s really just the iron or nickel.
    I am assuming the terminology.
    Just think of it as iron and nickel and there’s an insane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could have 
possibly used and there’s also more lithium than we could possibly use.
    Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium-ion cells.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors which is, you have suggested that between a 5x to 1</span><span class="r5">0x</span><span class="r5"> </span>
<span class="r5">improvement is achievable in automotive production versus the first Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> line on a first-principles physics analysis.</span>
    Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?
    Elon Musk

I think we are still quite far away from it.
    I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is for those who have never done production, they just don’t 
understand how insanely hard production is.
    I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
    Prototypes are trivial.
    They are child’s play.
    Production is hard.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">75</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
    But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> S/X 
per week.
    It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
    But it is a superior product.
    So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in <span class="r2">2021</span> and <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    We are building factories as quickly as we can.
    Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories 
this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.</span>
    In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other 
products.
    Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
    Now on to questions.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.

    Elon Musk

Okay.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Thanks, Elon.
    So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of <span class="r2">2021</span>, as Elon had 
mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
    To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
    First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the 
first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not </span>
<span class="r5">yet begun customer deliveries.</span>
    The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit 
generation.
    For example, we incurred an estimated $<span class="r2">200</span> million of direct P&amp;L impact relating to this program in Q1, the majority
of which is reflected in COGS and that’s before even considering the impact of lost revenue and profits as a result of 
the transition.
    And as Elon mentioned, we expect the first deliveries to begin shortly.
    Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly around semiconductors
and port capacities.
    While the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers did tremendous work keeping our factories running, we did 
experience high expedite costs in the quarter and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor 
interruptions to production over the course of the quarter.
    We believe that this landscape is improving, but it does remain difficult and it’s an evolving situation.
    If we double click within net income, auto gross margin excluding credits improved sequentially and year-over-year.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">10</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">18</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r8">[</span>Operator Instructions<span class="r8">]</span>

But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Thank you.
    So Q1 <span class="r2">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $</span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.</span>
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span class="r2">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
