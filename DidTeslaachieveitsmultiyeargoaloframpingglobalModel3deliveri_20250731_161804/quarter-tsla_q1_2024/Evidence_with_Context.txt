     Thanks.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
     It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
     We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
     Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5%.
     Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality.
>>> Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.
     In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model 3 ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved slightly.
     Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.
     Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
     We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
     Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
     We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
     On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.

2. [Sentence #26] [PLAN]
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
     We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
     It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
     And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
     Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.
>>> It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America.
     So it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
     So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
     Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
     It's really how humans drive.
     Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
     So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
     To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out.

     Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
     Lars Moravy

But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
     Elon Musk

Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price.
     And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing.
     So there’s like – you can’t just be static.
     You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what we’re doing.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
>>> And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model 3 is a fantastic car.
     I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different.
     I mean it looks and feels different.
     Not only it looks and feels different.
     We’ve added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as $299 a month.
     Lars Moravy

Without gas.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

All right.

     So my follow-up has to do with the first quarter deliveries and I’m curious as to whether or not you feel that supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results and maybe can you help us quantify that?
     And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in 2024?
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks to you.
     Q1 had a lot of different things which were happening.
     Seasonality was a big one, continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment.
     We had attacks at our factory.
>>> We had Red Sea attacks, we are ramping Model 3, we’re ramping Cybertruck.
     All these things are happening.
     I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period.
     And that gives us that confidence that, hey, we don’t expect these things to recur.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We think Q2 will be a lot better.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

It’s just one thing after another.

5. [Sentence #497] [UNCERTAIN]
     We think Q2 will be a lot better.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

It’s just one thing after another.
     Our Cybertrucks are crazy.
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     It’s just – if you’ve got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot delivered to people.
>>> And if you’ve got the excess demand for Model 3 and Model Y in one market, but you don’t have it there.
     It’s quite a – it’s extremely complex logistics situation.
     So, I’d say also the – we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we’ve just in the past week or so have greatly simplified.
     So, it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute.
     So, we’re getting back to that you can buy a Tesla in under a minute interface from what was quite complex.
     Martin Viecha

Okay, thank you.
     Let’s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
     Colin, go ahead and unmute, please.

     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
>>> So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
     Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.

     Let’s go to analyst questions.
     The first question comes from Tony Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
     Tony, please go ahead and unmute.
     Tony Sacconaghi

Thank you for taking the question.
     I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today.
     Are these like tweaks on existing models, given that they’re going to be running on the same lines?
     Are these like new models?
>>> And how should we think about them in the context of like the Model 3 Highland update, what will these models be like relative to that?
     And given the quick time frame, Model 3 Highland has required a lot of work and a lot of retooling.
     Maybe you can help put that all in context.
     Thank you, and I have a follow-up, please.
     Elon Musk

I think we've said, we were on that front.
     So what’s your follow-up?
     Tony Sacconaghi

It’s a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you’re leading many important companies right now.
     Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests and do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?

     Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%.
     We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.
     And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.
     Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter.
     On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing, and other activities.
     We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.
