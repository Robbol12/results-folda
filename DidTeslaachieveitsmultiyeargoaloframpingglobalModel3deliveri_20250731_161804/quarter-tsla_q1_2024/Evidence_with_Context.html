Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span class="r2">18.9</span>% to <span class="r2">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, </span>
<span class="r5">these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.</span>
    In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved 
slightly.
    Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span class="r2">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">26</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span class="r2">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span class="r2">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span class="r2">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span class="r2">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras </span>
<span class="r5">and inference computer and everything from Hardware </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> on in North America.</span>
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
    So, we now have over <span class="r2">300</span> billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span class="r2">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">442</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
    Lars Moravy

But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price.
    And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing.
    So there’s like – you can’t just be static.
    You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what 
we’re doing.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> is a fantastic car.</span>
    I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have 
actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different.
    I mean it looks and feels different.
    Not only it looks and feels different.
    We’ve added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as $<span class="r2">299</span> a month.
    Lars Moravy

Without gas.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    Martin Viecha

All right.

<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">485</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So my follow-up has to do with the first quarter deliveries and I’m curious as to whether or not you feel that 
supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results and maybe can you help us quantify 
that?
    And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks to you.
    Q1 had a lot of different things which were happening.
    Seasonality was a big one, continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment.
    We had attacks at our factory.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We had Red Sea attacks, we are ramping Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, we’re ramping Cybertruck.</span>
    All these things are happening.
    I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period.
    And that gives us that confidence that, hey, we don’t expect these things to recur.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We think Q2 will be a lot better.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

It’s just one thing after another.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    We think Q2 will be a lot better.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

It’s just one thing after another.
    Our Cybertrucks are crazy.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    It’s just – if you’ve got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot delivered to people.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And if you’ve got the excess demand for Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Model Y in one market, but you don’t have it there.</span>
    It’s quite a – it’s extremely complex logistics situation.
    So, I’d say also the – we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we’ve just in the past week or so have greatly
simplified.
    So, it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute.
    So, we’re getting back to that you can buy a Tesla in under a minute interface from what was quite complex.
    Martin Viecha

Okay, thank you.

    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those

    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont.</span>
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
    Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage 
deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy 
business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.

    Let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Tony Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Tony, please go ahead and unmute.
    Tony Sacconaghi

Thank you for taking the question.
    I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today.
    Are these like tweaks on existing models, given that they’re going to be running on the same lines?
    Are these like new models?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how should we think about them in the context of like the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> Highland update, what will these models be </span>
<span class="r5">like relative to that?</span>
    And given the quick time frame, Model <span class="r2">3</span> Highland has required a lot of work and a lot of retooling.
    Maybe you can help put that all in context.
    Thank you, and I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

I think we&#x27;ve said, we were on that front.
    So what’s your follow-up?
    Tony Sacconaghi

It’s a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you’re leading many important companies right now.
    Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests and do you expect to lessen your 
involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?
