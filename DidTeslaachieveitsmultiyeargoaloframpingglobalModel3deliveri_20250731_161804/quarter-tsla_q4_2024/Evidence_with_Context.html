America, Europe, and China?

    Or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, <span class="r5">&quot;Hey, I need to go back there and </span>
<span class="r5">I need to change something to enable the team better?&quot;</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I&#x27;m making here are going to be pretty accurate.
    And it&#x27;s worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon&#x27;s always late.
    Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I&#x27;m late but never reports when I&#x27;m early.
    So, sure, I&#x27;m optimistic but I&#x27;m not that optimistic.
    There are many cases in past where actually we&#x27;ve been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the 
factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
    So, yes.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m very confident we&#x27;ll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and </span>
<span class="r6">several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in </span>
<span class="r6">North America, at least.</span>
    I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it&#x27;s likely to be just regulatory.
    Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs 
to be addressed.
    This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
    So, guys, there&#x27;s too many reps in the field.
    For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we 
have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
    Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
    And there&#x27;s like this EU country committee.

    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span class="r2">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span class="r2">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when we look back on </span><span class="r6">2025</span><span class="r6"> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually </span>
<span class="r6">works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S </span>
<span class="r6">or the Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> or Model Y.</span>
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span class="r5">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.
    All right.

    Elon?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
    So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly <span class="r2">2</span> million a year.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.</span>

That&#x27;s worth noting.
    Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, No.
    <span class="r2">1</span> was Model Y.
    We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don&#x27;t know what -- really, I was going
to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it&#x27;s like autonomy is like 1<span class="r2">0x</span>-ing frankly.

    And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah, I&#x27;ll talk about things on Earth.
    As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro 
environment.
    We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
    For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who 
helped us achieve this.
    Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we 
accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
    This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which 
impacted ASPs.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the </span>
<span class="r6">Greater China market.</span>
    This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
    On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the 
recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
    Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $<span class="r2">35</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>, driven
primarily by material costs.
    This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for 
which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
    All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
    While we feel confident in our team&#x27;s abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change,
and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same 
time.
    This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
