Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in North America in Q1.
    I mean, that is indicative of the direction we&#x27;re heading with universal compatibility for all vehicles no matter 
where the charge port is, et cetera, in all major markets, and we&#x27;re going to continue to roll out those sort of 
improved offerings as we build new stations.
    We&#x27;re always balancing like our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve new customers when 
doing that.
    I think we&#x27;ve been able to balance it rather well.
    For example, in Europe, <span class="r2">50</span>% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we&#x27;ve been able to do that
without any increase in wait times at all for anybody.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in North America and China over the coming </span>
<span class="r5">quarters.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
    Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.
    I just wanted to first just follow-up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your cost position as others 
struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue, actually in a way that most other 
automakers will never see just given your service network and supercharging and other attributes.
    Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you&#x27;d be willing to take this?
    Are there brackets around the range of initial margin that you&#x27;d be comfortable with?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    The theme is actually -- is very common throughout the world, including in the US and really never -- it&#x27;s just a 
very common element on earth, is lithium.
    So, it&#x27;s much more a question of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up?
    That&#x27;s really what matters more than where is the lithium ore.
    It&#x27;s everywhere basically.
    I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode and to some degree, refining of the anode.
    And this is why we, at Tesla, we&#x27;re building our lithium refinery capability at Corpus Christi and our cathode 
refinery outside Austin.
    It&#x27;s worth noting, I hope other companies do the same thing.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will have, by far, the most lithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in North </span>
<span class="r5">America, I think, probably more than everyone else combined by a lot.</span>
    So, can other people please do those work?
    That would be great.
    We&#x27;re begging you.
    We don&#x27;t want to do it.
    Can someone please?
    Like instead of making a picture-sharing app, please, we&#x27;re trying, lithium, mining and refining, heavy industry, 
come on.
    Karn Budhiraj

It&#x27;s fun.

    Thanks.
    And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the past conference calls about opening up its 
vehicle charging network.
    Can you speak to some of the feedback you&#x27;ve been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners?
    And how the ramp of the charging network may progress from here?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

    And then just on the margins associated with Austin and Berlin.
    You mentioned Austin want to have the margin drag until you reach intended volumes.
    I don&#x27;t know if you can disclose what those volumes are.
    And then maybe you could just remind us of what the margin profile of Austin and Berlin will look like versus 
Shanghai once you get the vertical integration benefits in place?
    Elon Musk

Well, probably one have be quite as good as Shanghai.
    Shanhai is hard to -- has a very efficient cost structures, obviously, our lowest cost structure in the world.
    But we do expect to be -- make significant improvements in Austin and Berlin and continue to make improvements in 
Fremont as well.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So...</span>

<span class="r5">Roshan Thomas</span>

<span class="r5">For making improvements in North America &amp; Berlin cost structures, we&#x27;ve increased -- this is Roshan by the way.</span>
    We increased our localization efforts strategically.
    So that will then drive down our days on-hand requirements reducing tied up working capital.
    We&#x27;ve made <span class="r2">10</span>% quarter-over-quarter improvement in days on-hand.
    So we&#x27;ll continue that improve cost structure as supplier localization improves.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    And our final question comes from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">309</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So, I guess in which ways would you monetize it?
    Elon Musk

Sorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing because that&#x27;s sort of like a generic term for our 
next-generation vehicle.
    And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle.
    That&#x27;s going to be very compelling.
    This is just not the time to talk about it in details product.
    So, we internally call it robotaxi.
    But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will 
achieve full autonomy.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, there will be a like a Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi.</span>
    So, yes, that&#x27;s -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
    Emmanuel Rosner

Understood.
    And then maybe a question for Zach.
    Back on the automotive gross margins.
    So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive 
gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.
    Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened.
    Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">13</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just a Q1 recap.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United </span>
<span class="r5">States.</span>
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
