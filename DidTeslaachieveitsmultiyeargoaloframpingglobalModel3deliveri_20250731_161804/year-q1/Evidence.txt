[Year Q1] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #22]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) After the ****Model** 3** ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
2. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) In Q1, we produced more **Model** Ys in the first quarter than **Model** 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
3. [Sentence #57]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) So **Model** Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the ****Model** 3** and just despite being a bigger car that weighs more.
4. [Sentence #66]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly **global** manufacturer with major factories in ****North** **America****, **China** and **Europe** and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.
5. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) This is our second large-scale product launch since ****Model** 3** in 2017 and it's evidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency.
6. [Sentence #80]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) We also announced a long-range and performance variant of ****Model** 3** for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in **China**.
7. [Sentence #95]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) **Model** Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai.
8. [Sentence #100]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) Note that one of the most important aspects of **Model** Y in Fremont and ****Model** 3** in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
9. [Sentence #135]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range ****Model** 3** basically tomorrow, **China** time.
10. [Sentence #140]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the ****Model** 3** in Fremont, and there's still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
11. [Sentence #262]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) It’s not like ****model** 3** and Y – ****Model** 3** and Y also – they're way better than any other cars to the best of my knowledge.
12. [Sentence #380]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to ****Model** 3** as well, and so we have experience with that both with ****Model** 3** in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.
13. [Sentence #391]  (TSLA_Q1_2020) But for a five-seater **Model** Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the ****Model** 3** once we have reached say, 10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].
14. [Sentence #553]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) So ****Model** 3** became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
15. [Sentence #556]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) It’s been exceeded by the Tesla ****Model** 3**, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
16. [Sentence #557]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) For ****Model** 3** to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
17. [Sentence #558]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million **Model** 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
18. [Sentence #1014]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be **global** and **China** is **ramping** quite quickly.
19. [Sentence #1033]  (TSLA_Q1_2021) ****Model** 3** and **Model** Y were steps of improvement in that.
20. [Sentence #1158]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) What is the time line for localizing the ****Model** 3** in **Europe**, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?
21. [Sentence #1241]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Similar to ****Model** 3**, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve discussed is achieved.
22. [Sentence #1364]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) Dan Levy

Second question, one of the initial goals of ****Model** 3** way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market.
23. [Sentence #1552]  (TSLA_Q1_2022) And we are working on solutions in ****North** **America****, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being different than others, but we are moving in that direction.
24. [Sentence #1887]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) We will have, by far, the most lithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in ****North** **America****, I think, probably more than everyone else combined by a lot.
25. [Sentence #2066]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in **Europe** and our Magic Dock post in ****North** **America**** in Q1.
26. [Sentence #2071]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) So we're going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in ****North** **America**** and **China** over the coming quarters.
27. [Sentence #2166]  (TSLA_Q1_2023) So...

Roshan Thomas

For making improvements in ****North** **America**** & Berlin cost structures, we've increased -- this is Roshan by the way.
28. [Sentence #2223]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in ****North** **America****.
29. [Sentence #2254]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of ****Model** 3** in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.
30. [Sentence #2639]  (TSLA_Q1_2024) And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated ****Model** 3** is a fantastic car.
