    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in</span>
<span class="r5">North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> million units a year.</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.
    Thank you.

Thank you.
    And now to Zach&#x27;s opening remarks.

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin and thanks, Elon.

    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r5">3</span>
<span class="r5">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">80</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> for our road map, which will positively impact </span>
<span class="r5">ASPs in China.</span>
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">556</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2021]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So Q1 <span class="r2">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
    So Model <span class="r2">3</span> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span class="r2">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two </span>
<span class="r5">factories.</span>
    For Model <span class="r2">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span class="r2">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span class="r2">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span class="r2">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
    I’d say more likely than not that in <span class="r2">2022</span> Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2071</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in North America in Q1.
    I mean, that is indicative of the direction we&#x27;re heading with universal compatibility for all vehicles no matter 
where the charge port is, et cetera, in all major markets, and we&#x27;re going to continue to roll out those sort of 
improved offerings as we build new stations.
    We&#x27;re always balancing like our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve new customers when 
doing that.
    I think we&#x27;ve been able to balance it rather well.
    For example, in Europe, <span class="r2">50</span>% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we&#x27;ve been able to do that
without any increase in wait times at all for anybody.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in North America and China over the coming </span>
<span class="r5">quarters.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
    Rod Lache

Hi, everybody.
    I just wanted to first just follow-up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your cost position as others 
struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue, actually in a way that most other 
automakers will never see just given your service network and supercharging and other attributes.
    Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you&#x27;d be willing to take this?
    Are there brackets around the range of initial margin that you&#x27;d be comfortable with?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1158</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So, that’s my recommendation, is join the full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take 
note of the rate of improvement with every release.
    And we put out a new release roughly every two weeks.
    And you’ll see a little bit of two steps forward, one step back.
    But overall, the rate of improvement is incredibly quick.
    So, that’s my recommendation for reaching your own assessment is literally try it.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown in Shanghai have in Q2?
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the time line for localizing the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Europe, or will newer models be prioritized in Berlin?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, we did lose a lot of important days of production.
    And because there are sort of upstream supplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also have lost many days of 
production.
    But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance.
    So, I think notwithstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see record output per week from Giga Shanghai 
this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple of weeks.
    So, that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower, but it’s also 
possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.
    But it’s really, call it, roughly on par.
    But then, Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks.
    It&#x27;s important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective.
    We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, 
uncertain macroeconomic environment, and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier.
    Auto margins declined from <span class="r2">18.9</span>% to <span class="r2">18.5</span>%.
    Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs
and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that 
functionality.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, </span>
<span class="r5">these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.</span>
    In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved 
slightly.
    Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont.
    Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing 
Tesla&#x27;s relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.
    We&#x27;ve also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite 
for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.
    Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.
    We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.
    On the demand front, we&#x27;ve undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase 
and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in the U.S. for $<span class="r2">299</span> a 
month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">95</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y</span>
<span class="r5">in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai.</span>
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">10</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">380</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    So we started with deliveries of performance initially.
    And so that helps create some of the margin.
    And that will come down with time as more variants are released, and we have more of a steady-state mix.
    But it&#x27;s similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model <span class="r2">3</span> when we launched that product in Fremont two years ago.
    On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets.
    The commonality is huge.
    It&#x27;s very important.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> as well, and so we have experience with</span>
<span class="r5">that both with Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.</span>
    And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.
    So the ecosystem to support and launch the product is there.
    There remain a lot of opportunities to take -- continue to take costs out of the car.
    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
    And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model <span class="r2">3</span>
basically tomorrow, China time.
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already </span>
<span class="r5">lower than the cost to produce the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.</span>

    And so we&#x27;ll continue to bring the price down and expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this 
reduction in price that Elon mentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

    The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved by crisis.
    In which way has Tesla improved towards -- or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-<span class="r2">19</span>?

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; After the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.</span>
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.

    And to Elon’s point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable 
nature of our part arrivals, and our supply chain team, in particular, production planning portion of supply chain.
    We often get very little notice when there’s part shortage is coming, and it’s kind of a scramble couple of days 
before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here.
    And so, the amount of Herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that 
is absolutely immense.
    Elon Musk

There’s a saying in the military, it’s like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it 
comes to war.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So, there were some inherent cost improvements, as I mentioned, but there’s also offsets that we’ve talked about 
previously on raw materials, commodities.
    Outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring 
those costs down.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Dan Levy</span>

<span class="r5">Second question, one of the initial goals of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide </span>
<span class="r5">portion of the market.</span>
    And we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints.
    Prices are higher for all other automakers.
    We know that there’s inflation that you’re battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price 
of the vehicles.
    And you’re going to be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.
    So, it’s one of the points.
    But given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the 
progression of prices over time?
    Elon Musk

We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible.

Great.
    Thank you.
    So Q1 <span class="r2">2021</span> was a record quarter on many levels.
    Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $<span class="r2">1</span> billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
    We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
    So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an 
increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.</span>
    In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
    The BMW <span class="r2">3</span> Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
    It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model <span class="r2">3</span>, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two 
factories.
    For Model <span class="r2">3</span> to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
    In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $<span class="r2">0.25</span> million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized
rate of $<span class="r2">0.5</span> million per year.
    When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and 
probably, next year.
    So I am not <span class="r2">100</span>% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.

    Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
    This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever 
existed.
    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.

    The theme is actually -- is very common throughout the world, including in the US and really never -- it&#x27;s just a 
very common element on earth, is lithium.
    So, it&#x27;s much more a question of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up?
    That&#x27;s really what matters more than where is the lithium ore.
    It&#x27;s everywhere basically.
    I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode and to some degree, refining of the anode.
    And this is why we, at Tesla, we&#x27;re building our lithium refinery capability at Corpus Christi and our cathode 
refinery outside Austin.
    It&#x27;s worth noting, I hope other companies do the same thing.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will have, by far, the most lithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in North </span>
<span class="r5">America, I think, probably more than everyone else combined by a lot.</span>
    So, can other people please do those work?
    That would be great.
    We&#x27;re begging you.
    We don&#x27;t want to do it.
    Can someone please?
    Like instead of making a picture-sharing app, please, we&#x27;re trying, lithium, mining and refining, heavy industry, 
come on.

    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
    Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we&#x27;re making progress on improving capacity for Model Y
in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai.
    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> in Shanghai is the dramatically </span>
<span class="r5">improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.</span>
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
    More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.

    Thanks.
    And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the past conference calls about opening up its 
vehicle charging network.
    Can you speak to some of the feedback you&#x27;ve been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners?
    And how the ramp of the charging network may progress from here?
    Thanks.
    Elon Musk

Drew, do you want to take that?
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in North America in Q1.</span>
    I mean, that is indicative of the direction we&#x27;re heading with universal compatibility for all vehicles no matter 
where the charge port is, et cetera, in all major markets, and we&#x27;re going to continue to roll out those sort of 
improved offerings as we build new stations.
    We&#x27;re always balancing like our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve new customers when 
doing that.
    I think we&#x27;ve been able to balance it rather well.
    For example, in Europe, <span class="r2">50</span>% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we&#x27;ve been able to do that
without any increase in wait times at all for anybody.
    So we&#x27;re going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in North America and China over the coming 
quarters.

    And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, 
simply real-world artificial intelligence.
    And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer 
that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of <span class="r2">70</span> watts or <span class="r2">80</span> watts.

    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
    We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup 
production in the second half of <span class="r2">2025</span>, so we expect it to be more like the early <span class="r2">2025</span>, if not late this year.
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span class="r2">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span class="r2">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras </span>
<span class="r5">and inference computer and everything from Hardware </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> on in North America.</span>
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
    So, we now have over <span class="r2">300</span> billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span class="r2">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.

    We&#x27;re looking forward to continuing pushing for improved range over time and improving handling, acceleration and 
all those details that make Tesla special.
    For Model Y, we introduced a revolutionary two-piece -- we&#x27;re underway casting that we are going to be making a 
single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body is cast as a single piece, 
which is no casting of the size or complexity has never been done before.
    In fact, there isn&#x27;t even anything that is on par with the two-piece casting for the Model Y.
    So, we&#x27;re really pushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing.
    I&#x27;m very excited about this approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH.
    It&#x27;s better in every way essentially.
    For Model Y, we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car to have a higher range.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So Model Y has remarkable range on par with -- in fact slightly better than, I guess, the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and just despite </span>
<span class="r5">being a bigger car that weighs more.</span>
    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.

    And then just on the margins associated with Austin and Berlin.
    You mentioned Austin want to have the margin drag until you reach intended volumes.
    I don&#x27;t know if you can disclose what those volumes are.
    And then maybe you could just remind us of what the margin profile of Austin and Berlin will look like versus 
Shanghai once you get the vertical integration benefits in place?
    Elon Musk

Well, probably one have be quite as good as Shanghai.
    Shanhai is hard to -- has a very efficient cost structures, obviously, our lowest cost structure in the world.
    But we do expect to be -- make significant improvements in Austin and Berlin and continue to make improvements in 
Fremont as well.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So...</span>

<span class="r5">Roshan Thomas</span>

<span class="r5">For making improvements in North America &amp; Berlin cost structures, we&#x27;ve increased -- this is Roshan by the way.</span>
    We increased our localization efforts strategically.
    So that will then drive down our days on-hand requirements reducing tied up working capital.
    We&#x27;ve made <span class="r2">10</span>% quarter-over-quarter improvement in days on-hand.
    So we&#x27;ll continue that improve cost structure as supplier localization improves.

Okay.
    Let’s go to the next question.
    Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versus expectations set during the Battery Day in terms of 
expected range increase and dollars per kilowatt hour?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    We’re working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistent progress across all of those
areas towards achieving the five-year cost trajectory goals for the cost within our control, but we do not control all 
the commodity costs.
    So, that’s an exception I needed to call out.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Similar to Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve </span>
<span class="r5">discussed is achieved.</span>
    Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial <span class="r2">4680</span> and structural battery ramps.
    And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and 
higher-range structural pack provisions.
    Elon Musk

I think maybe, in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that <span class="r2">4680</span> and structural pack will be competitive with 
the best alternatives later this year.
    And we think we’ll exceed the best alternatives next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean we have some good existing proofs, right?
    Like we’ve built the facility here in Texas, like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility.

    Good afternoon.
    And thank you very much for taking the questions.
    I was hoping you could comment on your latest thoughts about potentially opening up the charging network in the U.S.
to non-Tesla orders.
    I mean, certainly really important to have a good experience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times and charge 
installs.
    But Tesla is able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the 
Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy a Tesla 
vehicles in the future.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    As Elon has said and as we’ve publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-party vehicle access in all over 
the world, not just in Europe, where our original pilot was.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we are working on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connector being </span>
<span class="r5">different than others, but we are moving in that direction.</span>
    I don’t know if you want to add.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think that’s -- there’s nothing more to be said on that, but we’re -- yes, we want to do the right thing with 
respect to the whole system.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And we’re going faster on adding chargers.
    With the growth of the cars that we’re producing and then anticipating what you were discussing, overall charger 
capacity is really important.
    And so, the pace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.

    Will you consider the heat pump water heater market as well?
    Elon Musk

Well, as I said on Twitter, I&#x27;m personally extremely excited to build HVAC – gas, HVAC system that also has sort of 
hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses, bacteria, pollen, fungi and 
also neutralizes specific alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient.
    And these are all things we&#x27;ve achieved in our cars.
    In fact, I don&#x27;t know if a lot of people realize, but the Model S are the only cars in the world that have a 
hospital operating room-grade heavy filters built-in.
    They&#x27;re very big.
    So – but you can get to a particle count that is insanely low with our cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And <span class="r2">3</span> and Y have like MERV <span class="r2">16</span> or <span class="r2">15</span> capable filter –

Elon Musk

Yeah.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; It’s not like model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Y – Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Y also – they&#x27;re way better than any other cars to the best of my </span>
<span class="r5">knowledge.</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal 
car.
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span class="r2">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.

    Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
    Lars Moravy

But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price.
    And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing.
    So there’s like – you can’t just be static.
    You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what 
we’re doing.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> is a fantastic car.</span>
    I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have 
actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different.
    I mean it looks and feels different.
    Not only it looks and feels different.
    We’ve added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as $<span class="r2">299</span> a month.

    And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasons that Elon had mentioned.
    We are also getting very heavy into <span class="r2">4680</span> development that Drew and team are working on and the associated structural
battery pack that goes along with that.
    And so these are new technologies, not only new to Tesla, but new to the industry.
    And so we are investing heavily there on an R&amp;D side to work out those kinks.
    And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue to work through the development cycle of 
those.
    Then I also mentioned, and Elon talked a bit about, Dojo and the potential there.
    So from neural net investments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and make 
investments in.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the SG&amp;A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global and China is ramping quite quickly.</span>
    And we are trying to make sure that we are staying ahead of the volume, so that we have the right sales capacity, 
store capacity there, local investments and IT and others to manage the growth, such that as the growth comes, the 
execution challenges are smaller than maybe in similar periods of growth that we have seen in the past and so we are 
making investments there ahead of the growth.
    And overall, as we look at OpEx as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we do expect to see a 
substantial drop from <span class="r2">2020</span> to <span class="r2">2021</span> as the volumes in the latter part of the year pick up.

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next question, please.
    Operator

Thank you.
    We have Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.
    Your line is open.

    And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter is quite limited relative to our goal.
    Elon Musk

It&#x27;s good.
    We take costs out of the car and to make the product better.
    So it&#x27;s tax.
    It&#x27;s not make the product worse.
    It&#x27;s -- and if we can take costs out of a car, make it worse, we want to take costs out of the car, figure out how 
we can make it lighter and simpler.
    And so it&#x27;s -- want the car to just incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering costs.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But for a five-seater Model Y, we expect marginal costs of that car to be comparable to the Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> once we have </span>
<span class="r5">reached say, </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> or </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5">,</span><span class="r5">000</span><span class="r5"> units or something like that and…[Technical Difficulty].</span>

Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, your conference will resume momentarily.
    Thank you.
    Speakers, you&#x27;re back online.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason.
    What was the question again?
    Okay.

    One is on COGS, I think, you have gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about the potential for COGS reduction 
related to Powertrain.
    But I’d like to get a sense of the path to reducing COGS ex-Powertrain as you would still need a meaningful 
reduction on that front to make the math work on a $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicle.
    So what levers do you have to reduce in your cost ex-Powertrain, is it just more scale, better supply pricing or is 
it just based on ongoing cost reductions?
    Elon Musk

I think all of the above.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    I mean, on the vehicle side, there’s plenty of opportunity as well.
    Obviously, building a car like a Model S is quite complex and has various moving parts.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> and Model Y were steps of improvement in that.</span>
    But when you look at some of the other advancements that we are including in the Model Y, factories into Austin and 
Berlin, we have reduced the body pound by as much <span class="r2">60</span>%.
    And the part costs money.
    So we continue to find optimizations there as well as we get economies of scale.
    When we start to talk about the volumes, we are considering worldwide with four factories building the same vehicle.
    So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve our COGS as well and the Powertrain continues to be 
integrated into that.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    And then just related, as we see Berlin and Austin ramp, I’d like to just get a sense on the comparison of Fremont 
versus the new capacity, obviously, Fremont is non-optimized because you bought the old NUMMI facility.

    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.</span>
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
