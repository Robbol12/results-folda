[TSLA_Q4_2023] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #209] [PLAN]
     It's pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, does the company anticipate a 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either of 2024 or 2025?
     If not, why not?
     Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before.
     We are between two major growth waves.
>>> The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.
     In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of the next generation vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is from Michael.
     When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
     Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.

2. [Sentence #65] [NO EVIDENCE]
     This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
     So there'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
     But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
     So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
     This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
     Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
     The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world.
>>> Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.
     In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment.
     And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing.
     But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
     I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
     And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come.
     Thank you.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

3. [Sentence #51] [PLAN]
     That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.
     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
     It's really quite remarkable.
     Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
     Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old.
     So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.
>>> So, the new Model 3 is now available globally.
     So we did an updated Model 3.
     While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way.
     It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements, and I recommend taking it for a test drive.
     If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the new one.
     So, steady improvements.
     And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
     This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.

4. [Sentence #18] [PLAN]
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
     So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023.
     We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
     And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year.
     This is really a phenomenal achievement.
     Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars.
     This is a record.
>>> In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
     And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area.
     It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps.
     And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
     What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
     Think about that.
     It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
     And it's enriched the community in so many different ways.

5. [Sentence #293] [UNCERTAIN]
     And also, we have new orders come in after the launch.
     The auto numbers keep growing.
     So we're now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation.
     And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery.
     So -- but really, the demand is off the hook.
>>> As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more.
     But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Definitely is.
     Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It's like finally, the future.
     Looks like the future.
     It's just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the Cybertruck.

7. [Sentence #44] [PLAN]
     There's a lot to look forward to in 2024.
     Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
     We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
     For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions.
     This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
     So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
     This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
>>> That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.
     So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls.
     We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets.
     It's really quite remarkable.
     Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
     Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old.

9. [Sentence #446] [UNCERTAIN]
     So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce.
     But I think some kind of update would be good to do.
     I'll talk it over with the team, and yeah, I think we might do something later this year.
     Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people thinking of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.
     Adam Jonas

Maybe as a follow-up.
     Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into Western markets.
     As the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in Western markets?
>>> And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States?
     Thanks.
     Elon Musk

Well, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world.
     So I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established.
     Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.
     So they're extremely good.
     We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner.
     Certainly, we're happy to, except on the supercharger front.

10. [Sentence #219] [PLAN]
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is from Michael.
     When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
     Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.
     Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
>>> It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly.
     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
     And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
