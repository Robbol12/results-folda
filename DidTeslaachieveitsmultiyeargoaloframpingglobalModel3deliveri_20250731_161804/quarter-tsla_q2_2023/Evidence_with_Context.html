America, Europe, and China?

    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r2">20</span> years of 
recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.
    On the residential side, we have some fun things happening.
    We recently surpassed <span class="r2">0.5</span> million Powerwalls installed.
    Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their
vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof.
    Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support 
to ERCOT.
    We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over 
time as ERCOT expands market access.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle </span>
<span class="r4">customers over the rest of the quarter.</span>
    Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers
requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
    In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access 
that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.
    For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system 
buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing 
incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

All right.
    I can take that.

    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just </span>
<span class="r4">as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just </span>
<span class="r4">making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car </span>
<span class="r4">companies.</span>
    And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD.
    So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves.
    We’re more than happy to license it to others.
    And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.
    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.

    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.

    Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy density than current 
production.
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span class="r2">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on </span>
<span class="r4">the revenue model?</span>
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.
    We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.

    There’s a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and 
multiple joining methods.
    Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out.
    Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled out.
    Dried adhesive has to be removed, stains, cut, blah, blah, blah.
    Elon Musk

It’s a crazy patch of a quilt.
    Lars Moravy

Yes.
    And so putting that back together means time and money.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from </span>
<span class="r4">Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, it’s </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4"> times cheaper and </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> times faster to do it with the cast rail.</span>
    Design team works with our collision repair team since we’re a closed loop on this with insurance, and we design 
specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair.
    And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops.
    We expect that we’ll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time.
    And we already make this available to all body shops or our Tesla-approved body shop training.
    Elon Musk

Yes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.
    Lars Moravy

Crucial.
    I don’t think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so.
