    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q3_2021]</span> Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model <span class="r2">3</span> deliveries from <span class="r2">2019</span> to <span class="r2">2020</span> across North
America, Europe, and China?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">20</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Overall, we delivered just over <span class="r2">240</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars, <span class="r2">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span class="r2">70</span>% higher than the same quarter 
last year.
    We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over <span class="r2">1</span> million cars towards the end of the 
quarter.
    The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
    Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to 
ramp and deliveries of Model X.
    It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
    But based on demand, we&#x27;re targeting to exceed historical production levels.
    We&#x27;ve also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.</span>
    Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
    It&#x27;s important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally 
difficult to achieve.
    I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive 
flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
    These teams&#x27; expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these 
challenges.
    Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we&#x27;re adding capacity as quickly as 
possible.
    I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
    Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average 
customer wait times are extending.

    We have seen an increase in service late times throughout the summer, and there&#x27;s a couple of things that have 
contributed to that based upon the information that we had.
    The first is that I think this is not -- this is not unique to us is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a 
post-pandemic world has happened I think more quickly than most people expected.
    And what we&#x27;re seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased.
    There may have been some demand for service during <span class="r2">2020</span> or in the early parts of <span class="r2">2021</span> that customers put off.
    And so, there&#x27;s a bit of a catch-up that&#x27;s occurring that has increased demand for service.
    At the same time, in the macro-environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts, has become increasingly 
more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market.
    And so, there&#x27;s this simultaneous increase in demand for service, where the ability to supply that service has been 
impacted for the reasons I mentioned.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And so, we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America and service wait times over the course of the summer.</span>
    And we&#x27;ve been working extremely hard since then to address this.
    And we&#x27;ve seen our wait times come down.
    So, this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspectives, we are 
seeing improvements there.
    We remain super-focused on adding locations.
    And so, over the last year, we&#x27;ve grown our physical footprint of service centers by <span class="r2">35</span>%.
    We&#x27;ve grown our footprint of mobile repair by over <span class="r2">40</span>%.
    We&#x27;re also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and 
demand for service.

    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span class="r2">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> 
million units with just S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, truck and the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> car?&quot;
    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Model Y segments, where Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> is currently</span>
<span class="r4">the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.</span>
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for 
the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

    We&#x27;re continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial 
metrics for Q3.
    Overall, we delivered just over <span class="r2">240</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars, <span class="r2">20</span>% higher than last quarter, and <span class="r2">70</span>% higher than the same quarter

    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span class="r2">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> model 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and </span>
<span class="r4">Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Y production in Fremont and </span>
<span class="r4">Shanghai.</span>
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
