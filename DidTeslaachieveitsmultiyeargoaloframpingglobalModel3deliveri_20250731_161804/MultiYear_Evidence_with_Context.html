    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
    We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in</span>
<span class="r5">North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5"> million units a year.</span>
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.

    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Even with all the challenges, we achieved a </span><span class="r5">20</span><span class="r5">% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping </span>
<span class="r5">two major products.</span>
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
    Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.

    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.
    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; All of those confirmations are training under old methods.</span>
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
    It’s the reason I say it&#x27;s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is 
training Google all the time with their searches.
    So, when you&#x27;re searching something and you click on a link, you&#x27;re training Google every time you do that.
    It&#x27;s very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
    So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be able to drive through an intersection
without a confirmation as well as to make turns.

    Different conversations.
    Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
    Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
    I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s a fair question.
    I don&#x27;t have any additional color to provide.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span class="r5">8.1</span><span class="r5"> billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q1, we&#x27;re managing it very closely.</span>
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver
at the end of Q1.
    So we&#x27;re making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity.
    And as we&#x27;ve been looking at liquidity, we&#x27;ve been looking at this over the next <span class="r2">18</span> months, and there&#x27;s ups and 
downs to the liquidity.
    Currently now, as we&#x27;re not producing, we still have payables from Q1 that we&#x27;re paying off.
    But then in a couple of months, we&#x27;ll quickly be through that, and then we&#x27;ll have a gap in payables since we don&#x27;t 
have any parts coming in.
    So it does go up and down a little bit.
    But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we&#x27;re managing it right now, we feel pretty comfortable with 
the liquidity position of the company.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
    So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the 
feature suite is rolled out.
    Elon Musk

Absolutely.
    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Martin Viecha</span>

<span class="r5">Thank you.</span>
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span class="r2">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
    Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to <span class="r2">10</span> years?
    This would be <span class="r2">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span> and more than <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r2">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
    And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is 
– will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of 
time.
    So we do understand that some customers who have ownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that 
option upfront.
    And so this will enable those customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    At a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area under the curve of customer happiness.
    That is our goal.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we think that, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that all companies should try to do.</span>
    And it&#x27;s what results in long-term value creation and loyalty – the guest loyalty.
    So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we&#x27;re confident that if we behave like 
that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEV subsidy program that disqualifies
Tesla vehicles from benefiting from the subsidies.
    To what extent is there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer, so 
they can qualify for the subsidy?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.

    So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production costs in China.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model </span><span class="r5">3</span>
<span class="r5">basically tomorrow, China time.</span>
    So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, China time.
    And there will be a price below the subsidy limit.
    And we feel confident that that&#x27;s will still be a vehicle that delivers a good gross margin.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced in Shanghai in Q1 is already 
lower than the cost to produce the Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont, and there&#x27;s still significant opportunity left to take costs out.
    So fixed cost absorption from higher production volumes, which are occurring in Q2 and will occur through the rest 
of the year were not fully localized on the supply chain yet.
    And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it&#x27;s not complete, and there&#x27;s additional opportunities there.

    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
    I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone 
else combined.

    I&#x27;m very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla team this past quarter.
    A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned.
    We successfully launched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y, as Elon mentioned, significantly 
ahead of schedule.
    This is our second large-scale product launch since Model <span class="r2">3</span> in <span class="r2">2017</span> and it&#x27;s evidence to the progress we&#x27;ve made on 
cost control and ramp efficiency.
    It&#x27;s hard to understate the significance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of 
production.
    Our Shanghai Model <span class="r2">3</span> margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents of Model 3s built in 
Fremont.
    This is despite not yet running at full capacity, while also managing through the production shutdown in early 
February.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5"> for our road map, which will positively impact </span>
<span class="r5">ASPs in China.</span>
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite 
charges taken in Q1 associated with production downtime.
    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
    We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted
overall profitability.

    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So, Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.
    This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.
    Even with all the challenges, we achieved a <span class="r2">20</span>% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits while ramping 
two major products.
    What we&#x27;ve learned from this is that -- we&#x27;ve obviously learned a lot here.
    After the Model <span class="r2">3</span> ramp from three years ago, our new products get run faster and become profitable sooner.
    In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter than Model 3s in Fremont in the first two quarters.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster than the Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1.</span>
    Most surprisingly, as otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule that we were ahead of already.
    Most surprisingly, Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter of production, something we haven&#x27;t achieved 
with any product in the past.
    Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to Early Access Users in 
March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week.
    Our cars will not automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic light until the driver gets a confirmation to 
proceed.
    I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but we are only exposing functionality that we
feel quite good about and where we feel it is probably a safety improvement.
    We are collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> million intersections every month at this point.
    This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people start driving again.

    Soon, we will be collecting data from over <span class="r2">1</span> billion intersections per month.
    All of those confirmations are training under old methods.
    Essentially, the driver went driving and taking action is effectively labeling -- the labeling reality as they drive
and making them better and better.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we&#x27;re quite literally orders of magnitude more than everyone </span>
<span class="r5">else combined.</span>
    I think, this is difficult to fully appreciate.
    It’s the reason I say it&#x27;s very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google because everyone is 
training Google all the time with their searches.
    So, when you&#x27;re searching something and you click on a link, you&#x27;re training Google every time you do that.
    It&#x27;s very difficult for any new search engine to compete on that basis.
    So, all those confirmations of training and all that, and certain cars will be able to drive through an intersection
without a confirmation as well as to make turns.
    And we really feel we&#x27;re -- I feel extremely confident that it would be possible to do a drive from your home to 
your office most of the time with no interventions by the end of the year.
    So, this is -- we can almost do this already with the leading-edge Alpha  driving the car.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">20</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">210</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to <span class="r2">10</span> years?
    This would be <span class="r2">4</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2025</span> and more than <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2030</span>.
    Is <span class="r2">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span class="r2">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span class="r2">40</span>%.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than </span><span class="r5">40</span><span class="r5">%, even with force majeure Model </span><span class="r5">3</span><span class="r5">.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question from retail investors.
    When will you announce the next Giga?
    How many Gigas, do you have planned for the next five years?
    Elon Musk

I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
    We may not – as soon as next month.
    This is not a prediction, just saying.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So essentially, we need to figure out, get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns in 
intersections and things like busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that 
kind of thing, when those eventually come back.
    Those are extra hard cases.
    But it&#x27;s all tracking very well.
    If you like, the water pallets engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I&#x27;m deeply 
involved with the team.
    So we talk every week and meet every week when we can, as now physical meeting is difficult.
    So I have quite a deep understanding where we are, where we&#x27;re headed.
    And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we&#x27;ll have the functionality that’s really cool, also 
driving by the end of the year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now after that functionality is released, there&#x27;s still another step, which is to improve the reliability of it, </span>
<span class="r5">once it is released, to kind of core self-driving with the human -- supervised by the driver.</span>
    And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver.
    And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.
    And then presumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for the autonomous 
cars that can drive with no human onboard.
    Obviously, the regulatory approval process that&#x27;s difficult for us to predict with accuracy, because it&#x27;s out of our
hands.
    But for the rest of it, I feel very good about where we are.
    Gene Munster

So, to summarize, we want -- we&#x27;re going to give owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year.
    Then a human is in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year?
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and 
profitability to the company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re working towards restarting production as soon as that&#x27;s possible.
    We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
    Our vehicle inventory balance increased by <span class="r2">14</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in
Q1, but it&#x27;s helpful in Q2.
    Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai is the dramatically 
improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
    While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online 
orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
    However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance 
and we will need to work through how quickly we&#x27;ll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.</span>
    Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our
cash flows during this time.
    The Tesla team has done a great job here.
    We&#x27;ve also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to 
drive efficiencies throughout the business.
    Overall, we&#x27;ve modeled many scenarios into <span class="r2">2021</span> and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed 
fully with our most important, long-term investments.
    It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the 
substantial work we&#x27;ve done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
    And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
    So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.

    And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experience investing at the highest levels in the world and has done 
great work as -- at the Japan Pension Fund, which is the largest fund of any kind in the world.
    And generally, the conversations over the years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the 
global security markets work and what he thinks it is, whether are historical.
    It just -- it seems like he has a strong philosophical understanding about how to make the future better.
    And he shares our view regarding the environment and just a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the 
Board and I think is generally recognized as such by many people.
    Ben Kallo

I guess leaking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going?
    And is there any read-through on bringing him on to the Board?
    Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">No.</span>
    I think this is set right through with the Panasonic relationship.
    I mean, I have a great relationship with Panasonic&#x27;s CEO.
    We meet regularly one on one and talk at the time.
    So, that relationship is strong.
    Just that he&#x27;d bring more of a broader and a global, strategic view to the Board.
    Martin Viecha

    And the heat pump is a key contributor to that.
    It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving.
    So -- and the feedback we&#x27;re getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally 
positive.
    We&#x27;re confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.
    So in conclusion, and just to -- looking forward, I guess this is a forward-looking statement we are absolutely 
continuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai and here in Fremont when 
they will let us continue.
    Localized production in China and in Europe will bring the cost down, making our products even more competitive over
time.
    While many other companies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re absolutely pedal to the metal on new products and expanding the company.</span>
    And we&#x27;re really looking forward to being in sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in
North America, China and Europe and a capacity of well over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year.
    So there&#x27;s a tremendous amount to look forward to and we can&#x27;t wait to tell you what&#x27;s going to happen.

    It&#x27;s a question of will.
    Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it?
    So -- and yeah, we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation
of the past.
    If this was <span class="r2">1920</span>, do you want to be investing in steam engines or in commercial engines?
    Obviously that’s not steam engines.
    So this is the time to think about the future and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people&#x27;s rights, as what
is happening right now.
    I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry, because somebody should really -- if 
somebody wants to stay in their house, that&#x27;s great.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; They should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave.</span>
    But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist.
    This is not democratic.
    This is not freedom.

    Please go ahead.
    Adam Jonas

Thanks everybody.
    I hope everyone&#x27;s safe and healthy.
    I got one question, one follow-up.
    And I&#x27;d point out, I&#x27;ve had a root canal before, and I would agree, Elon.
    It was less painful than buying a car.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r5">I mean, really, it&#x27;s -- yeah, exactly.</span>
    Adam Jonas

It&#x27;s a big problem, actually.
    It&#x27;s a big problem.
    Different conversations.
    Zach, first for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end of April?
    Some companies have given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little color on that.
    I just want to give you a shot at that, and I got a follow-up.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">28</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">270</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    They&#x27;re not quite as good as possible operating room, but they are extremely good, way better than any other normal 
car.
    And we&#x27;re continuing to improve the filters on <span class="r2">3</span> and Y.
    These actually have a big effect on health even in normal just day-to-day living.
    It&#x27;s reducing particle count and it has vector on allergies and all sorts of things.
    So it&#x27;s really – air quality is incredibly important even in non-COVID situations going forward.
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r5">Yeah.</span>
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
    So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new 
Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
    Elon Musk

    And we&#x27;ve talked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well.
    So I think that there&#x27;s clearly an uncertain future ahead.
    It&#x27;s a bit of a bumpy road.
    But I think the long-term prospects are extremely good.
    Anything you guys want to add?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, I agree with Elon.
    The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute more efficiently and faster on them, which I think 
is great.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The other one that I would add is, it&#x27;s always been our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make </span>
<span class="r5">that as digital as possible.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Touchless delivery.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah, So touchless delivery.
    Mobile service touchless sales has been something that we&#x27;ve been very focused on and made a lot of progress on.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than five minutes on your phone, you can order a car 
and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done.

    We also announced a long-range and performance variant of Model <span class="r2">3</span> for our road map, which will positively impact 
ASPs in China.
    On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of government incentives at the 
end of Q4.
    In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.
    Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit.
    Automotive gross margin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products, despite

    We continue to make progress on OpEx efficiency, as well as our service and other margins.
    Our energy business was impacted as well by shutdown activities in Q1 limiting deployments.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We also experienced expected launch efficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted</span>
<span class="r5">overall profitability.</span>
    As I&#x27;ve noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which our credits we sell to other carmakers to generally 
increase with time.
    This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
    And note that most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it&#x27;s reflected in the accounts 
receivable on the balance sheet.
    Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary – by the temporary increase in end of quarter inventory for all 
our products resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.
    Had these interruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong free cash 
flows.
    As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-term plans and technology 
road map.
    We are taking the near-term actions required to continue those investments.
