America, Europe, and China?

    So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
    I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
    I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.

<span class="r4">The next question is, when do you expect Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> Highland to be available in the U.S.?</span>
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
    Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver <span class="r2">2.3</span> million vehicles in <span class="r2">2024</span>, representing <span class="r2">28</span>% growth 
versus <span class="r2">2023</span> guidance.
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r2">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.

    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span class="r2">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
    It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to <span class="r2">18</span> months before it is a significant 
positive cash flow contributor.
    I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
    The demand is off the charts.
    We have over <span class="r2">1</span> million people who’ve reserved the car.
    So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, 
insanely difficult things.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to </span>
<span class="r4">target -- expect to have around </span><span class="r4">1.8</span><span class="r4"> million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.</span>
    The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it 
comes to real world AI.
    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
    And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
    Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.

    So, a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.
    Martin Viecha

Sounds good.
    And the last question from investors is Neural net path planning represents a significant advance in capability and 
safety for FSD.
    What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Our approach has been to try to get it -- like the more places we’re trying to make it work, the harder the problem 
is.
    So, the reason we don’t do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work 
anywhere at all.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, that’s why it’s currently just North America.</span>
    And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you can
deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you’re deploying.
    So, it’s -- most countries require some sort of extensive approval program.
    So, we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it’s kind of ready for prime time in 
that country.
    I apologize it’s not in those countries, but we keep plenty of ways to make it better.
    And it really needs to drive such that it exceeds the -- even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability of
entry of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of entry than a human by far.
    I think we’re tracking to that point very quickly.
    Obviously, in the past, I’ve been overly optimistic about this.

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r2">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
