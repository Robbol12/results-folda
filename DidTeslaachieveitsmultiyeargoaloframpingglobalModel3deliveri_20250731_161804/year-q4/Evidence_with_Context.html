    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that
layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars <span class="r2">3</span> 
and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, </span>
<span class="r4">a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.</span>
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.

    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company.
    Deliveries reached over <span class="r2">112</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles in a single quarter.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $<span class="r2">20</span> billion in 
revenue with zero advertising spend.
    I think that&#x27;s like where we do say that from time-time and I think it&#x27;s often overlooked, but to have the highest 
demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of 
the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of 
advertising.
    At our Fremont factory we&#x27;re producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 
<span class="r2">2006</span> and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
    This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there&#x27;s lot of 
potential to go beyond that number.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the Shanghai factory I&#x27;d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> last </span>
<span class="r4">quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.</span>
    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span class="r2">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span class="r2">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span class="r2">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It&#x27;s pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
    The next question is, does the company anticipate a <span class="r2">50</span>% volume CAGR to be realized in either of <span class="r2">2024</span> or <span class="r2">2025</span>?
    If not, why not?
    Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won&#x27;t be growing at the same rate as before.
    We are between two major growth waves.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first one began with the global expansion of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with </span>
<span class="r4">the next generation platform.</span>
    In <span class="r2">2024</span>, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of 
the next generation vehicle.
    Martin Viecha

All right.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is from Michael.
    When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of 
these to produce their first products such as <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
    Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
    But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in 
Austin before we start construction.

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
    And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in
California and also the Model <span class="r2">3</span> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that

    We delivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history.
    So, really an incredible growth rate and despite a very challenging <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    So, my hat is off to such a hard work with such great people at Tesla.
    So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $<span class="r2">2.8</span> billion after spending more than $<span class="r2">3</span> billion on 
building new factories and other expenditures.
    We reached industry-leading GAAP operating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.
    Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of new capacity.
    We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and have almost reached full production speed.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We ramped the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai to more than </span><span class="r4">5</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow </span>
<span class="r4">rapidly.</span>
    We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.
    We ramped the single piece -- we started and we&#x27;re able to ramp to volume production at the single-piece castings 
for Model Y.
    This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeleton of the car is being cast as a single 
piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.
    We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in one year.
    We&#x27;re also building Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year.
    And lastly, we built a cell -- a battery cell factory in the Bay Area.
    And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity is large enough that it would be in the -- 
probably the top <span class="r2">10</span> battery cell factories on earth despite being a pilot plant.

    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
    We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model <span class="r2">3</span> and remain focused on continuing the production 
ramp and managing costs.
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
    For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which </span>
<span class="r4">I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.</span>
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
    At this point, we&#x27;re expecting a <span class="r2">1</span> to <span class="r2">1.5</span> week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span> due to a government 
required factory shutdown.
    This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
Shanghai remains in the early stages.
    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.

    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I&#x27;m making here are going to be pretty accurate.
    And it&#x27;s worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon&#x27;s always late.
    Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I&#x27;m late but never reports when I&#x27;m early.
    So, sure, I&#x27;m optimistic but I&#x27;m not that optimistic.
    There are many cases in past where actually we&#x27;ve been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the 
factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
    So, yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m very confident we&#x27;ll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and </span>
<span class="r4">several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in </span>
<span class="r4">North America, at least.</span>
    I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it&#x27;s likely to be just regulatory.
    Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs 
to be addressed.
    This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
    So, guys, there&#x27;s too many reps in the field.
    For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we 
have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
    Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
    And there&#x27;s like this EU country committee.

    We&#x27;ve also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and
the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
    Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $<span class="r2">82</span> million driven almost entirely by an expense 
related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
    This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied 
to.
    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent 
quarters.
    As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This year for the Shanghai built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.</span>
    In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the 
region.
    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
    We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model <span class="r2">3</span> and remain focused on continuing the production 
ramp and managing costs.
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.

Hi, good evening, everybody.
    So in your slide deck, you had the comments around average selling price being stable or thereabouts in <span class="r2">2020</span>.
    Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric evolve, obviously you 
have the Model Y which probably would have initial higher pricing and then the China Model through at a lower price.
    So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like steadily in <span class="r2">2020</span>?
    Elon Musk

Making the price better and better, so is the value.
    I know we&#x27;re wondering we come out of prices and so I think or adjust according to what the demand looks like, I 
mean like right now it&#x27;s pretty good, maybe they will change who knows, yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

But I think the way you described, it is fair.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I mean, relative to the current Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, China Model </span><span class="r4">2</span><span class="r4"> pricing is slightly lower.</span>
    And our Model Y pricing is public on the website.
    So you can see that it&#x27;s clearly slightly higher than what Model <span class="r2">3</span> is out of Fremont.
    How the mix of those three products and that&#x27;s out over the course of the year, we&#x27;ll see.
    I think it&#x27;s probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those stays fairly stable in terms of ASP, when you 
average them together.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I mean the affordability of our car and trying to improve radically because for a very -- to tariffs mostly going 
to weigh, purchase tax exemption, local cost supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it over the 
ocean.
    So the affordability is nine day for our car intent.

    So that&#x27;s and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to issues that arise.
    So, I think we&#x27;re just going to have go as best we can with Model Y and make sure it&#x27;s a great product.
    I think there are some things that will differentiate it, but not -- does on our October analyst call.
    And I think, so when they do, when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they will be impressed about some of
the things they see.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And just to add to that, I think it&#x27;s important to keep the Model Y launch in context over the next <span class="r2">18</span> to <span class="r2">24</span> months.
    But what we&#x27;re working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have <span class="r2">3</span> and Y locally produced in all 
location.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span class="r4">And so, Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> is expanding as Model Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of</span>
<span class="r4">having these products on the major continents.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes.

Also the rule of thumb of <span class="r2">10</span>%, I think you need to see it when you see the car, you realize that it&#x27;s not just a <span class="r2">10</span>%

    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it </span>
<span class="r4">does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating </span>
<span class="r4">production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> or Model Y cars.</span>
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.

    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.

Thank you.
    We are going to take the first question from retail investors compiled by SAY  Technologies.
    So the first retail investor question is since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do 
you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share.
    What&#x27;s the <span class="r2">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not</span>
<span class="r4">just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in </span>
<span class="r4">North America on the order of </span><span class="r4">4</span><span class="r4"> million new roofs per year.</span>
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
    So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot 
of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">14</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2100</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r4">[NO EVIDENCE]</span>
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.
    So there&#x27;ll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming.
    But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls.
    So -- but we&#x27;re very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the 
vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system.
    This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive 
manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin.
    Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be 
manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.
    The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then 
we&#x27;ll follow that up with other locations around the world.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably the factory we&#x27;ll build in Mexico will be second, and then we&#x27;ll be looking to identify a third location, </span>
<span class="r4">perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.</span>
    In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite 
of a very high interest rate environment.
    And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and 
it is very hard to do all these things, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.
    But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world.
    I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and 
previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes.
    And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking 
forward to a great <span class="r2">2024</span> and years to come.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.
    However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line revenue.
    Overall, we believe this will set us up for a strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted
cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet.
    For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality.
    Additionally, we are in the process of ramping two major products Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which 
I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
    We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the 
Coronavirus.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; At this point, we&#x27;re expecting a </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4"> to </span><span class="r4">1.5</span><span class="r4"> week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> due to a government </span>
<span class="r4">required factory shutdown.</span>
    This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
Shanghai remains in the early stages.
    We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont.
    So far we&#x27;re not aware of anything material, but it&#x27;s important to caveat that this is an evolving story.
    However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans, while further strengthening the balance 
sheet.
    Thank you again for your support and we will turn to questions.

    That&#x27;s over <span class="r2">400</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles in North America.
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle 
controls.
    We replaced <span class="r2">330</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> lines of C++ code with neural nets.
    It&#x27;s really quite remarkable.
    Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
    Out of necessity, we&#x27;ve actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> at
this point is several years old.
    So I think we&#x27;re quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is
going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, the new Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> is now available globally.</span>
    So we did an updated Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way.
    It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements, and I 
recommend taking it for a test drive.
    If you have not driven a Model <span class="r2">3</span> in a long time, you should really try the new one.
    So, steady improvements.
    And we&#x27;re very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.
    This is an earnings call, not a product announcement.

    And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
    Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model <span class="r2">3</span> 
there.
    We have talked a lot about the CapEx being of capacity being lower, but I mean you can basically run down entire 
list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization, opening up suppliers that would not have made 
economic sense from the states.
    Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well, so we&#x27;re not shipping
cars from California over to China.
    And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import related costs.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in</span>
<span class="r4">California and also the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> factory in China and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that</span>
<span class="r4">layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.</span>
    And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in
China relative to Fremont, but I think it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that 
we&#x27;re selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
    And so and I&#x27;ve said this on previous earnings calls, I think it&#x27;s fair to expect margin coming out of the Shanghai 
facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont.
    Elon Musk

Yes, there is a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars <span class="r2">3</span> 
and the Y, at least on the continent where the customers are.
    It kind of makes sense it&#x27;s -- but what we&#x27;re doing will happen, during the past was really pretty silly in making 
cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe.
    And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on 
the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it&#x27;s -- and then the factory complexity 
in California is very high, because you&#x27;ve got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.
    So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it&#x27;s very complex and just having a factory in China, 
a factory in California, a factory -- North America factory in Europe.
    Well, just that alone is a massive improvement in our formula operating efficiency.

    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.
    On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent 
quarters.
    As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    This year for the Shanghai built Model <span class="r2">3</span>, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
    In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of plant supply chain localization at the factory or in the 
region.
    This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and remain focused on continuing the production </span>
<span class="r4">ramp and managing costs.</span>
    We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of the Shanghai and Berlin built Model Y, which will
result in continued increases in capital spending.
    On operating expenses I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product pipeline and 
international footprint.

    Jerome?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    Well, as far as best service, no service.
    So we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the quality and the reliability of our cars.
    In the last two years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by one-third.
    So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, no service.
    And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than </span><span class="r4">40</span><span class="r4">% of all visits in North America.</span>
    We&#x27;re trying to push that to <span class="r2">50</span>% this year.
    In <span class="r2">50</span>% of service visits lasts less than two hours.
    So we&#x27;re trying to service the cars very quickly, so people can get their vehicles back on the road.
    And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.
    We have about -- we have actually <span class="r2">140</span> service centers right now in North America.
    For <span class="r2">100</span> out of those <span class="r2">140</span>, you can get appointments in less than <span class="r2">10</span> days.
    And we&#x27;re going to make sure it&#x27;s all service centers are -- have a short wait time.

    So we expect a pretty dynamic <span class="r2">2021</span> in the regulatory space.
    We have leadership in the U.S. looking for manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high 
reliability before releasing to wider and wider groups.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks, guys.
    And then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets.
    Obviously, there&#x27;s a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space.
    Can you talk a little bit about the supply chain and how you&#x27;re migrating some of your exposure around some of your 
raw material costs?
    Jerome Guillen

This is Jerome.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in </span>
<span class="r4">particular, both between Asia and North America.</span>
    But we&#x27;re also looking forward to pricing, and we&#x27;re watching this very closely for all the components.
    We are entering a series of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only you&#x27;re going to 
have enough quantity to support the growth, <span class="r2">50</span>% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also good pricing with appropriate 
sharing of the risk.

    Thanks, Martin.
    This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this 
happen.
    On <span class="r2">2019</span> a few key points I&#x27;d like to highlight.
    On demand, while we&#x27;ve mentioned a few times, it&#x27;s worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we&#x27;ve 
transitioned entirely from generating Model <span class="r2">3</span> orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
    We&#x27;ve also seen a stabilization of Model <span class="r2">3</span> ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we&#x27;ve seen an increase in ASPs of
S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
    With respect to capacity expansion, we&#x27;ve greatly learned from the development and launch of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont and 
Reno.
    As a result, we&#x27;ve been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is evidenced by the launch of Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> in Shanghai, as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both </span>
<span class="r4">launched in under one year.</span>
    Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled to higher volumes, 
improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and 
operational costs.
    And we were able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled 
strong cash generation.
    We&#x27;ve also made progress on recurring and software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and
the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.
    Finally on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $<span class="r2">82</span> million driven almost entirely by an expense 
related to the next tranche of the CEO grant.
    This is a result of our improved, expected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied 
to.
    As we look ahead to <span class="r2">2020</span>, this again will be an important year for the company.
    Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth, while managing cash flows to support that growth.

    Elon Musk

Thank you.
    So the Tesla team did an incredible job in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    We achieved record production and deliveries of over <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
    And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost <span class="r2">2</span> million cars a year.
    This is really a phenomenal achievement.
    Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made <span class="r2">560</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars.
    This is a record.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it&#x27;s the highest output of automotive plants in North America.</span>
    And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco
Bay area.
    It&#x27;s a little counterintuitive, perhaps.
    And it&#x27;s really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
    What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.

    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    So now let&#x27;s switch to institutional shareholder questions.
    The number one question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being <span class="r2">65</span>% lower CapEx per unit of 
capacity.
    Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective?
    And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?
    Elon Musk

Sure, go ahead, Zach.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">there.</span>

    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
    The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production 
credits for battery cells packs?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So $</span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">700</span><span class="r4"> per long-range Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $</span><span class="r4">45</span><span class="r4"> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much </span>
<span class="r4">does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?</span>
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">25</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2780</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as
much demand as we can possibly make.
    So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that&#x27;s starting operation, and we&#x27;re building a third factory.
    So, we&#x27;re trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
    Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from <span class="r2">1</span> pocket to take to 
another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications 
or mobile applications?
    It can&#x27;t go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
    But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a 
very, very big way over time.
    So, in conclusion, <span class="r2">2025</span> really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And when we look back on </span><span class="r4">2025</span><span class="r4"> and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually </span>
<span class="r4">works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S </span>
<span class="r4">or the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> or Model Y.</span>
    In fact, I think it probably will be viewed <span class="r8">&#x27;25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla&#x27;</span>s history.
    There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
    I don&#x27;t even know who&#x27;s in second place.
    Like you say, like, who&#x27;s in the second place for real-world AI?
    I would need a very big telescope to see them.
    That&#x27;s how far behind they are.
    All right.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how much of Tesla&#x27;s margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, 
production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant
locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
    And how much further could margins improve and why?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Basically -- yes, there&#x27;s basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in 
the Company.
    And they&#x27;re in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
    So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we&#x27;ve ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    And so that is helpful on our margins.
    And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve 
and the costs go down as well.
    The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
    And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we&#x27;ve also -- that factory had a 
different line design, more efficient from the start, and we&#x27;ve been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.
    So, that has been helpful.
    If you recall at the beginning of the year, we also were in a transition to the new version of the Model S and Model
X.
    And so, as that has ramped over the course of the year, that has been helpful.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">27</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2328</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r7">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    And also, we have new orders come in after the launch.
    The auto numbers keep growing.
    So we&#x27;re now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained 
situation.
    And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn&#x27;t feel right to us to sort of gouge people for 
early delivery.
    So -- but really, the demand is off the hook.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of </span><span class="r4">0.25</span><span class="r4"> million, something </span>
<span class="r4">like </span><span class="r4">0.25</span><span class="r4"> million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more.</span>
    But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Definitely is.
    Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It&#x27;s like finally, the future.
    Looks like the future.
    It&#x27;s just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there&#x27;s some very good trucks on the road, but if you 
were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn&#x27;t hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the 
Cybertruck.

    So, basically, price really matters.
    I think there&#x27;s just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can&#x27;t afford it.
    And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.
    It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how 
important affordability is.
    And it&#x27;s always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I&#x27;m glad 
that we&#x27;re able to do so.
    And yes, so I think it&#x27;s a good thing, all things considered.
    We&#x27;re also making very good progress on cost control and we&#x27;re seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop 
commensurate with the growth in production, as you&#x27;d expect, so yeah.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly </span><span class="r4">400</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> </span>
<span class="r4">customers in North America.</span>
    This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest 
AI-powered autonomy.
    And we&#x27;re currently at about <span class="r2">100</span> million miles of FSD outside of highways.
    And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it&#x27;s very 
clear.
    So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.
    Regarding batteries, production rate of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells reached <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week at the end of last year, and we&#x27;re 
increasing capacity for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells by another <span class="r2">100</span> gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.
    Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to 
use the self cell providers.
    So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">29</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">2054</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q4_2023]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So the Tesla team did an incredible job in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    We achieved record production and deliveries of over <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
    And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost <span class="r2">2</span> million cars a year.
    This is really a phenomenal achievement.
    Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made <span class="r2">560</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars.
    This is a record.
    In fact, it&#x27;s the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco</span>
<span class="r4">Bay area.</span>
    It&#x27;s a little counterintuitive, perhaps.
    And it&#x27;s really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
    What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
    Think about that.
    It was derelict when we got it, and now it&#x27;s the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
    And it&#x27;s enriched the community in so many different ways.
    It&#x27;s really a gem.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    There&#x27;s a lot to look forward to in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Tesla is currently between two major growth waves.
    We&#x27;re focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full 
self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible.
    For full self-driving, we&#x27;ve released Version <span class="r2">12</span>, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior 
versions.
    This is end-to-end artificial intelligence.
    So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference.
    This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. 
who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s over </span><span class="r4">400</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> vehicles in North America.</span>
    So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle 
controls.
    We replaced <span class="r2">330</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> lines of C++ code with neural nets.
    It&#x27;s really quite remarkable.
    Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.
    Out of necessity, we&#x27;ve actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> at
this point is several years old.
    So I think we&#x27;re quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is
going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.
    So, the new Model <span class="r2">3</span> is now available globally.
