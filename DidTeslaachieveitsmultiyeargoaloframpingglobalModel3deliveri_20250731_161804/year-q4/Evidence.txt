[Year Q4] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #23]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching ****Model** 3** last quarter and achieving the first **deliveries** earlier this year.
2. [Sentence #55]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This is evidenced by the launch of ****Model** 3** in Shanghai, as well as **Model** Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.
3. [Sentence #65]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) This year for the Shanghai built ****Model** 3**, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates.
4. [Sentence #68]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally-built ****Model** 3** and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs.
5. [Sentence #74]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Additionally, we are in the process of **ramping** two major products ****Model** 3** in Shanghai and **Model** Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins.
6. [Sentence #76]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built ****Model** 3** due to a government required factory shutdown.
7. [Sentence #87]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So it's a [real hard] [ph] to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not just through Tesla [source] [ph], but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in ****North** **America**** on the order of 4 million new roofs per year.
8. [Sentence #159]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for the ****Model** 3** there.
9. [Sentence #163]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And there is a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the ****Model** 3** factory in **China** and the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.
10. [Sentence #164]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And so if you add all of this up our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of ****Model** 3** in **China** relative to Fremont, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus in that we're selling out of Shanghai is of lower than that of the similar car coming out of Fremont from price perspective.
11. [Sentence #168]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And this created a lot of cost, because you got to ship those cars, so they got lot of finished goods, sitting on the order or waiting at the port or going through customs, tariffs, transport, it's -- and then the factory complexity in California is very high, because you've got different regulatory requirements in **China**, ****North** **America**** and **Europe**.
12. [Sentence #169]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So we got three different types of cars that are being built, it's very complex and just having a factory in **China**, a factory in California, a factory -- ****North** **America**** factory in **Europe**.
13. [Sentence #270]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure ****Model** 3** or **Model** Y cars.
14. [Sentence #303]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) Zachary Kirkhorn

And so, ****Model** 3** is expanding as **Model** Y is expanding, may be ups and downs various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.
15. [Sentence #353]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So I mean, relative to the current ****Model** 3**, **China** **Model** 2 pricing is slightly lower.
16. [Sentence #461]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We ramped the ****Model** 3** in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, and Shanghai continues to grow rapidly.
17. [Sentence #654]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in ****North** **America****.
18. [Sentence #783]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) Yes, for supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions from COVID and the shipping, in particular, both between Asia and ****North** **America****.
19. [Sentence #1289]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) And the reason that matters is the **Model** Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the ****Model** 3**.
20. [Sentence #1556]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in ****North** **America****.
21. [Sentence #1627]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) So $3,700 per long-range ****Model** 3** and **Model** Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
22. [Sentence #2053]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in ****North** **America****.
23. [Sentence #2054]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in ****North** **America**** is in the San Francisco Bay area.
24. [Sentence #2079]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) That's over 400,000 vehicles in ****North** **America****.
25. [Sentence #2086]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) So, the new ****Model** 3** is now available globally.
26. [Sentence #2100]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of ****North** **America****.
27. [Sentence #2244]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) The first one began with the **global** expansion of ****Model** 3** and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.
28. [Sentence #2328]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in ****North** **America****, maybe more.
29. [Sentence #2780]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the **Model** S or the ****Model** 3** or **Model** Y.
30. [Sentence #3051]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) But I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in **America** by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in **America** next year, at everywhere in ****North** **America****, at least.
