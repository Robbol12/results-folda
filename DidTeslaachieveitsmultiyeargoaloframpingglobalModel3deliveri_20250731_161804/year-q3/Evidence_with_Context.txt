[Year Q3] Did Tesla achieve its multi-year goal of ramping global Model 3 deliveries from 2019 to 2020 across North America, Europe, and China?

1. [Sentence #666, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter, and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.
     We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.
     The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
     Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to ramp and deliveries of Model X.
     It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
     But based on demand, we're targeting to exceed historical production levels.
     We've also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
>>> This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
     Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
     It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.
     I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.
     These teams' expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference in managing through these challenges.
     Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast with our suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible.
     I also want to thank our suppliers for the dedication and partnership to Tesla.
     Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending.

2. [Sentence #1401, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
     I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
     It’s not a number.
     It’s [indiscernible] table.
     You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
     And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
     As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
>>> So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.
     And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America.
     And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle.
     So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?
     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?
-----
3. [Sentence #2278, TSLA_Q3_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     And that should be substantial, but we're aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab.
     That will be in more than one factory, but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately.
     So, yes, these are just my best guesses but if you ask me my best guesses, those are my best guesses.
     The cell 4680 lines, the team is actually doing great work there.
     The 4680 is rapidly approaching the point where it is the most competitive cell.
     So, when you consider the fully landed -- the cost of a battery pack fully landed in the U.S., net of incentives and duties, 4680 is tracking to be the most competitive, maybe lower cost per kilowatt hour, fully considered than any other alternative, which is -- we're not quite there yet but we're close to being there, which I think is extremely exciting.
     And we've got several -- a lot of ideas to go well beyond that.
>>> So, I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680 -- we'll have the -- the Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost competitive cell in North America, a testament to the tremendous amount of hard work there done by the team.
     So, that's to say we'll continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors.
     I tend not to provide -- to make cells just internally.
     So, I don't want to sort of here.
     We're obviously increasing substantially our vehicle output and our stationary storage output, so we need a lot of cells.
     And most of them will still come from suppliers.
     But I think it is some good news that the Tesla internal cell is likely to be the most competitive in the U.S.
     So, with respect to autonomy, as people are experiencing in the cars really from week to week, there are significant improvements and the miles between interventions.

Thank you.
     The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp?
     And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells?
     And how will that change in the next year?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said.
     Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter.
>>> Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.
     On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing.
     And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
     Elon Musk

Right.
     Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially.
     And yes, it’s going well.
     We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

[Indiscernible]

Elon Musk

Yes.

5. [Sentence #803, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     We have seen an increase in service late times throughout the summer, and there's a couple of things that have contributed to that based upon the information that we had.
     The first is that I think this is not -- this is not unique to us is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened I think more quickly than most people expected.
     And what we're seeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased.
     There may have been some demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off.
     And so, there's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring that has increased demand for service.
     At the same time, in the macro-environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts, has become increasingly more difficult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labor market.
     And so, there's this simultaneous increase in demand for service, where the ability to supply that service has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned.
>>> And so, we saw an uptick primarily in Europe and North America and service wait times over the course of the summer.
     And we've been working extremely hard since then to address this.
     And we've seen our wait times come down.
     So, this is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspectives, we are seeing improvements there.
     We remain super-focused on adding locations.
     And so, over the last year, we've grown our physical footprint of service centers by 35%.
     We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%.
     We're also adding staffing as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance of supply and demand for service.

6. [Sentence #1464, TSLA_Q3_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform.
     It will be smaller, to be clear.
     But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
     I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform.
     But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target.
     So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again.
     It’s like, we’re going to take two.
>>> That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Effort costs.
     Elon Musk

Yes…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
     Elon Musk

We’re twice the output.
     And we do believe this can be done.
     By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn’t including Optimus.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

7. [Sentence #2308, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PILOT]
     And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc.
     By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average, even in miles per critical intervention collision, in that case.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, that is just unvarnished, our internal estimate.
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Yes.
     Yeah.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, that's not sandbagging or anything else.
     Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter.
>>> A vast majority of humanity has no idea that Tesla could drive themselves so especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car.
     So, you don't expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself.
     A Cybercab looks different.
     A Cybertruck looks different, but Model Y and Model 3 are -- look, they're good-looking cars but look fairly normal.
     You don't expect a fairly normal-looking car to have the intelligence, enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it does.
     So, we do want to expose that to more people, and so we're doing -- every time we have a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another sort of 30-day trial to encourage people to try it again.
     And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption.
     So, the take rate for FSD has improved substantially, especially after the 10/10 event.

8. [Sentence #732, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
     The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster iteration.
     So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is, "Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet will be necessary to achieve 20 million in annual volumes?
     The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over 1 million units, so is it possible to achieve 20 million units with just S, X, 3, Y, truck and the $25,000 car?"
     Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
>>> As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 and Model Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
     As we mentioned at our shareholder's meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
     Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
     As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
     Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla 's goal for vehicle production capacity for the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by 2024?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
-----
9. [Sentence #1402, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
     It’s not a number.
     It’s [indiscernible] table.
     You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck.
     And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year.
     As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production.
     So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America.

10. [Sentence #1234, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PILOT]
     The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
     And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
     Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
     Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially.
     Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
     So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
     I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
>>> So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
     So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now.
     So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.
     So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
     Let’s see, with respect to demand.
     We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks.
     I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see.
     So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong.

11. [Sentence #125, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4 billion, our highest yet.
     Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefit from working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite a reduction in days available.
     Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by the strengthening of our core operations.
     Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y incidents in Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin.
     As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting these programs to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.
     Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund.
     This is driven by an increase in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturing as well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.
>>> While we expect the return on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope and location-specific costs, payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.
     Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a $5 billion equity raise in September.
     Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in early convert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and 2024.
     Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business.
     We are increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higher efficiency across the business, and tightening our cash conversion cycle.
     We've made tremendous progress on this front over the last year and a half.
     We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020 guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year.
     While this goal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.

12. [Sentence #1877, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
     I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
     I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
     I don’t think it’s nothing.
     But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
     So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
     So, this is big deal.
>>> Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.?
     I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
     So let’s go to the next one.
     Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance.
     Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024?
     And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
     Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces.
     I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.

We don't see any with the test.
     You either do it -- fix the issue upstream, or you would remotely do it through software, maybe at work or at home or carpark.
     And we've addressed the fixed issue.
     And we've partnered the field with service to make sure we're looking at the same issues.
     And additionally, just in Q3 and Q4 of this year alone, we have opened and will open in total of nearly 70 locations.
>>> And in North America, we significantly expanded the size of each location and have doubled the size last year compared to this year.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     I think it was like actually a lot of merit of having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor.
     You can start your approach -- yeah, it should be more factory-like where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service.
     And it's way easier for somebody to become expert in a few different types of repairs than in every repair.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Exactly.
     This has helped us with the base that the heavy repairs, like, the dedicated lanes for different type of repairs.

Hi.
     Good evening.

     Just wanted to start with a question on the quarter.
>>> Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of where directionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to Fremont Model 3?
     And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Was this just purely a function of higher volume?
     Or was there also FSD revenues?
     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.

     Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficiencies in our service operations.
     In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided by the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deployments grow.
     Additionally, our filler deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on that front.

Thanks.
     Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion.
     Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
     While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing incentives.
     As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
     We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter.
     We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year.
>>> To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
     And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.
     As customers' acceptance of EV growth, we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling leads.
     Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory.
     To support this strategy, we're continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more.
     While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners.
     We plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers.
     Automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a feature release discussed before.

     Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.

     There may be some periods of time in which we're well ahead of that.
     There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower than that.
     But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.

     Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Sure.
     On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release.
     It's not particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter.
     With respect to product margins, what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.
     Shanghai continues to make good progress there.
     Model Y cost is also coming down quite quickly as we ramp that.
>>> But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to the Model 3 built in Fremont costs.
     It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target as Model 3 Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.
     But we're generally seeing strength in Shanghai margin strength in Model Y margins.
     And not too far off of this, we're seeing strength in Model 3 Fremont and S and X margins.
     So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite a good story for the products.
     Dan Levy

Great.
     Thanks.
     And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.

20. [Sentence #662, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Zach?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     We're continuing to make great progress as a Company, setting new records on each of the most important financial metrics for Q3.
     Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars, 20% higher than last quarter, and 70% higher than the same quarter last year.
     We were also able to achieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.
     The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at our Shanghai factory.
>>> Additionally, we have made great progress, increasing production volumes of Model S, and have recently started to ramp and deliveries of Model X.
     It will take a bit more time to get this program back to prior volumes.
     But based on demand, we're targeting to exceed historical production levels.
     We've also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as our main export hub.
     This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and to introduce Model Y to Europe.
     Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at full capacity.
     It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this has been exceptionally difficult to achieve.
     I want to thank our supply chain team for their incredible work and our production teams for showing impressive flexibility as we make adjustments real-time.

     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, to recap, as someone was saying, something that what -- the industry was seeing year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3.
>>> Tesla, at the same time, has achieved record deliveries.
     In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide, to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable.
     And I'm not -- to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing car company that is profitable.
     So, it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment, and this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us.
     So, we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday, so congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla.
     That's staggering the immense amount of work to make 7 million cars.
     So, you see, we all have -- the energy storage business is growing like wildfire with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall.
     And as you all know, on October 10, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and future that I think is very compelling that the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an option to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots working among the craft, not with a canned video and a presentation or anything but walking among crowd so he drinks and whatnot.

22. [Sentence #2401, TSLA_Q3_2024] [UNCERTAIN]
     Thank you very much, Elon.
     And Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks.
     Our Q3 results were positive and once again demonstrate the scale to which the business has evolved or with generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion.
     Our automotive revenues grew both quarter on quarter and year on year.
     While we had unit volume growth, we did experience a reduction in ASPs primarily due to the impact of financing incentives.
     As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to revenue.
>>> We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about, in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter.
     We continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year.
     To expand on this at an industry level, China continues to outperform U.S.

and Europe by a factor of three.
     And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions.
     As customers' acceptance of EV growth, we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling leads.
     Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory.
     To support this strategy, we're continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more.
     While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap not just with buyers but at times even with existing owners.

23. [Sentence #716, TSLA_Q3_2021] [PLAN]
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $25,000 model in 2023.
     What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, we're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
     I think Zach spoke to that well.
     And we're doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
     We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we're generally in a cell constrained world.
>>> While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and Berlin, ramping S&X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont and Shanghai.
     As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
     And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the table.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
     Lars Moravy

At this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we've collected.
     This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
     In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.

24. [Sentence #1794, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla.
     So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
     It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor.
     I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
     The demand is off the charts.
     We have over 1 million people who’ve reserved the car.
     So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things.
>>> In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year.
     The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI.
     I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
     And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
     Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
     And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
     Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.

25. [Sentence #1942, TSLA_Q3_2023] [PLAN]
     So, a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.
     Martin Viecha

Sounds good.
     And the last question from investors is Neural net path planning represents a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD.
     What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Our approach has been to try to get it -- like the more places we’re trying to make it work, the harder the problem is.
     So, the reason we don’t do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere at all.
>>> So, that’s why it’s currently just North America.
     And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you’re deploying.
     So, it’s -- most countries require some sort of extensive approval program.
     So, we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it’s kind of ready for prime time in that country.
     I apologize it’s not in those countries, but we keep plenty of ways to make it better.
     And it really needs to drive such that it exceeds the -- even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability of entry of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of entry than a human by far.
     I think we’re tracking to that point very quickly.
     Obviously, in the past, I’ve been overly optimistic about this.
-----
26. [Sentence #66, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.
     That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.
     Then in terms of capacity build out.
     We're making progress on three major factories.
     We're continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well at Tesla China team.
     It is just, I mean, incredibly good.
     Super smart, work hard.
>>> It's like I'm always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes.
     It's beyond all reasonable expectations.
     And then we're under construction in Berlin and Austin.
     So we're also making good progress there.
     Yes.
     It’s good.
     So it’s overall going well.
     I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin, we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year.
-----
27. [Sentence #1333, TSLA_Q3_2022] [PLAN]
     So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
     Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
     Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising?
     There are three questions there.
     Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
>>> We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate.
     It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more.
     In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We could, but who wants?
     Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
-----
28. [Sentence #63, TSLA_Q3_2020] [PLAN]
     So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train the system on this corner case situation and look for examples, so we can then train against those examples and improve some very esoteric corner case.
     And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.
     There is no need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection.
     So the car -- the system is designed such that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have never been to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like a person.
     That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.

29. [Sentence #2466, TSLA_Q3_2024] [PLAN]
     But the next stage in that, really as it fits into AI road map, is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the initial cost of getting into an EV -- and those -- that's really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI road map.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
     It will be like with incentive.
     So, 30K, which is kind of a key threshold.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     Similar question next.
>>> When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

We're not breaking it on --

Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah, all our vehicles today are --

Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, I think we've made very clear that we're -- the future is autonomous.
     I mean, it's going to be -- I've actually said this many years ago, but that in my strong belief and I believe that is panning out to be true, very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles.
     And nonautonomous gasoline vehicles here will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone.
     It's not that there are no horses.
     Yes, there are some but they're unusual.
     They're niche.
     And so, everything is going to be electric autonomous.

Great.
     Thanks.
     And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe.
     And I think your strategy generally has been, you cut costs and that allows you to cut price and you can generate the extra volume.
