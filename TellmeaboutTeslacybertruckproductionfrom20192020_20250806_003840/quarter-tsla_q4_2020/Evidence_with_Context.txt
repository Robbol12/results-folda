[TSLA_Q4_2020] Tell me about Tesla cybertruck production from 2019-2020

1. [Sentence #317] [PLAN]
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
     So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development?
>>> What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
     Elon Musk

All right.
     So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
     So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
     We've got the designs fixed.
     We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
     We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
     So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.

     So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
     8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
     And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
     If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can start with questions in the queue.

3. [Sentence #195] [UNCERTAIN]
     So, it is a whole thing in and of itself.
     And this is something which we offer potentially as a service.
     So, some of the others need neural net training, we're not trying to keep it to ourselves.
     So, I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
     And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from 100% to 200% better than average human to 2,000% better than average human.
     So, that will be very helpful in that regard.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is what is Tesla's current gigawatt-hour run rate of the 4680 cell production?
     How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?
     Elon Musk

I think we kind of talked about that true.
     I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022.
     It's not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
     But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Yes.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Tesla's Q4 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast.
     At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
     After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.
     [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
     [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
     Please go ahead, sir.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone.
>>> Welcome to Tesla's fourth quarter 2020 Q&A webcast.
     I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
     Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.

7. [Sentence #302] [PLAN]
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
>>> So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
