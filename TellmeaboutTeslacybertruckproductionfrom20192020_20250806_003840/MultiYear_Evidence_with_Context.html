    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.</span>
    And we&#x27;ll be doing Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the eastern half of North America.
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.

    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling

    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">detail on production plans?</span>
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
    And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
    And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of 
Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue 
probably one level.
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?

    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons for Model Y.

    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now we can start with questions in the queue.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">5</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years.
    If you look back <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years from today to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> times more cars in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> then we

    So where we will be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.

    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>

    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.</span>

    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that 
Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Cybertrucks?</span>
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
    So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it 
does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating 
production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> or Model Y cars.
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.

    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">20</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> million units </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">beyond Model </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">3</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">275</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q1_2020]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #808000; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #808000">PILOT</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #808000; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    So taking all those things that we&#x27;ve replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is 
just very exciting.
    And then you&#x27;ve got – if you&#x27;re condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you 
possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other 
way around.
    So lots of options.
    Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
    So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">Zachary Kirkhorn</span>

<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">New technologies.</span>
    Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
    Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
    We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and
most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
    Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
    Elon Musk

Well, we haven&#x27;t really thought about that yet.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">11</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    So, it is a whole thing in and of itself.
    And this is something which we offer potentially as a service.
    So, some of the others need neural net training, we&#x27;re not trying to keep it to ourselves.
    So, I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself.
    And then, of course, for training vast amounts video data and getting the reliability from <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span>% to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span>% better than

    So, that will be very helpful in that regard.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is what is Tesla&#x27;s current gigawatt-hour run rate of the </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">4680</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> cell production?</span>
    How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span> or end of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

I think we kind of talked about that true.
    I mean essentially, what we&#x27;re saying is that the number to think about or focus on is like we&#x27;ve got a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">100</span> 
gigawatt-hour total Tesla cells produced in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    It&#x27;s not that important to look at the run up to that because -- but these things tend to improve exponentially.
    But we are installing capacity for -- in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span> for <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">200</span> gigawatt hours a year and we think probably we should be able 
to achieve <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">30</span>% of targeted design capacity in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">12</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
    So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck 
development?
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.</span>
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons for Model Y.
    So <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">6</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons was the biggest cast in the world.
    <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>.

    And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.
    This is -- never been done before, so there&#x27;ll probably be some challenges along the way.
    And obviously, something that&#x27;s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s manufacturing challenges there.
    That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cleaner.
    Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
    Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; If it goes well, we&#x27;ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next -- towards the end of next </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">year, yes.</span>
    So it&#x27;s difficult to predict.
    I would say there&#x27;s probably a lot of deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2022</span>, and some deliveries towards the end of next year, if 
things go well.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And now I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
    So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it&#x27;s going to be almost <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">850</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> units on an 
annualized basis.
    And you&#x27;re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.

    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">such product should look.</span>
    So it really just from the standpoint of what&#x27;s the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks 
the ass of any pickup truck, basically that&#x27;s the goal.
    And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand 
has been incredible.
    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while

    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span>

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
    Please go ahead, sir.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you, Sherry and good afternoon everyone.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Welcome to Tesla&#x27;s fourth quarter </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">2020</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> Q&amp;A webcast.</span>
    I&#x27;m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
    Our Q4 results were announced at about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> P.M. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this 
webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today&#x27;s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">[</span>Operator Instructions<span style="font-weight: bold">]</span> But before we jump into the Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">17</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">.

    And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to 
continue to fund additional factory.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that 
Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.
    Operator

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.</span>
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
    So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it 
does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating 
production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span> or Model Y cars.
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">18</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">2532</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2020]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
    And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of 
Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue 
probably one level.
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">development?</span>
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">19</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">. [Sentence #</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">1826</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; font-weight: bold">, TSLA_Q4_2019]</span> <span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">[</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080">PLAN</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">]</span>
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
    And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve 
got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the 
full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> years.</span>
    If you look back <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years from today to <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> times more cars in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> then we 
produced in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2010</span>, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">8</span>,<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">000</span> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
    So where we will be in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.

    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    What&#x27;s the <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we do -- we are seeing,  from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for our Solarglass 
Roof.
    So it&#x27;s a   to predict what that will be this year except that the demand is very strong and we are working also not
just through Tesla  , but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether is in 
North America on the order of <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> million new roofs per year.
    So, we see a lot of interest and so it&#x27;s just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews
trained to do the installation.
    But over time I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something - to use solar glass in one form 
or another.
    It&#x27;s really going to be your choice, do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without.
    And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and it looks good and lasts long time and it&#x27;s the 
future we want.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So it will be a significant product but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and that there is a lot </span>
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome and this will be a major product line for Tesla.</span>
    And the Buffalo factory is doing great.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Second question from retail shareholders is, will you release the Tesla  network app before full autonomy and change
the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers on the network.
    If so when will this happen?
    Might want to target California airport first, also good place to add Superchargers.
    Elon Musk

Sorry, it sounds like more question then one?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a bundle, yes.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
<span style="color: #7f7f7f; text-decoration-color: #7f7f7f">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Yes.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.

Our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
    Please go ahead.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hey thanks for taking my question.
    A very simple one.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; You haven&#x27;t talked that much about like the Cybertruck today.</span>
    And I was wondering how like the ramp of that product is looking like?
    When we should see the product hitting the road?
    And how fast do you expect to ramp volumes?
    Then I have a quick follow-up.
    Elon Musk

Sure.
    I was in the studio actually on -- last Friday with Frans and the team just going over the -- just some improvements
to the Cybertruck.
    Generally, with -- it sounds like we really aim to make the car that is delivered better than the car that is 
unveiled.

Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone.
    Welcome to Tesla&#x27;s First Quarter <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2020</span> Q&amp;A Webcast.

    There&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot
-- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
    And that&#x27;s something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the 
end of the year, as a subscription.
    So that&#x27;s just a lot of untapped potential there.
    That&#x27;s not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it&#x27;s certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think
is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And now let&#x27;s go through the questions from retail investors.
    Question number one, Elon has mentioned a <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">50</span>% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
<span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this still in line with Tesla&#x27;s ambitions for the next five to </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000; font-weight: bold">10</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0; text-decoration-color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #800000"> years?</span>
    This would be <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">4</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2025</span> and more than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">20</span> million vehicles in <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2030</span>.
    Is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% or more realistic target?
    Elon Musk

Well, it&#x27;s always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
    I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of 
came out of nowhere.
    So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>% is the 
likely number.
    It&#x27;s possible that is <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%.
    I would be very shocked, if it&#x27;s less than <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">40</span>%, even with force majeure Model <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">3</span>.
