[TSLA_Q4_2021] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023â€“2024?

1. [Sentence #262] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
     We'll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin and Austin?
     And timing for new factory announcements?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we want to comment on -- like that's -- it's always possible to increase the output of any given factory, to say, what's the next capacity?
     Well, it's difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot.
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.

     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.

3. [Sentence #57] [PLAN]
     The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.
     So, both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
     This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
     So, last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
     And that was not the only supply chain issue.
     So there's just hundreds of things.
     And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
     So, that's a good result.
     But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
     So, if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
     And the same is true of this year.
     So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
     It would not make any sense because we'll still be part constrained.
>>> We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
     That is most likely.
     But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
     So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
     This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
     If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
     Capital equipment is distilled labor.
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
     Sure.

     And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.
     And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.

     The second one here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the Company.
     And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we've also -- that factory had a different line design, more efficient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.

7. [Sentence #434] [PLAN]
     But there will be a challenge with traffic.
     So, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, and now I think it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of cars on the road.
     I mean, it's going to be -- I think it's way cheaper to draw a price point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past three or four years will be capable of that, than a bus or a subway, will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.
     So, if we want to get -- I'm not going to take the bus.
     If it costs you -- I don't know for arguments sake $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, taking the bus, especially in cold weather or dark or maybe a little bit dangerous or that.
     I just do not understand how profound change this is.
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
     You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
     That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
     And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
>>> If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
     If an asset has 5 times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.
     So, if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because still you don't want to drive.
     So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
     So, it's probably better than 5 times, I don't know.
     Yes.
     I mean, basically, if the cost of our cars do not change at all, we would still sell as many as we could possibly make.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
     So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter and at the same time that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
     And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally.

Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2021 Q&A Webcast.
     My name is Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.
     Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the Raise Hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
>>> So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
     And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year, we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year.
     This level of growth didn't happen by coincidence.
     It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.
     Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin.
     Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
     This is a critical milestone for the Company.
     So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
     So, we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
     But that's not the most important thing.
     We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
     But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
     So, in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and weâ€™ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
     Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future.
