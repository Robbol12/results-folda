[TSLA_Q1_2021] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #76] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.
     So -- and then to be in sort of fairly high-volume production for the S in Q3 and to start delivering the Model X in Q3 as well.
     So I think as we ramp up, I think, probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high.
     So surely, it’s going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes.
     So probably, we are -- like we are going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week, perhaps, if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500.
     This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
     And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
>>> In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Thanks, Elon.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of 2021, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
     First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.

     Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium-ion cells.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors which is, you have suggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in automotive production versus the first Model 3 line on a first-principles physics analysis.
     Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?
     Elon Musk

I think we are still quite far away from it.
     I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is for those who have never done production, they just don’t understand how insanely hard production is.
     I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
     Prototypes are trivial.
     They are child’s play.
     Production is hard.
     It is very hard.
     Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low-cost, insanely difficult.
     But what Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
>>> The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.
     So this is -- this -- basically myself and NIO and Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
     It was so hard.
     You have no idea.
     So anyway, and the thing about making a large complex manufactured object is let’s say that you have a closer approximation 10,000 unique items.
     If even one of those items is slow, that sets your rate, just one.
     Isn’t that so trivial?
     We have had a production stop because of carpet in the trunk.
     We had a production stop because of a USB cable.
     At one point for the Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics store in the Bay Area for a few days there.
     Nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because we went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.
     And there are like hundreds of stories like that.
     So anyway, solving that, those constraints, and a logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial.
     I am not kidding.

     Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.
     This is a huge problem.
     But then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China, because we are unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions.
     So - which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada.
     So that was a very challenging situation.
     I think we are mostly out of that particular problem.
     But that’s just - those were just two of many challenges.
     So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages.
     So with respect to Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Plaid Model S or what we call the Paladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has a revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.
     There’s just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was as also we’re saying was quite hard, because [inaudible] in a smaller pace.
     So it took quite a bit of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe.
     Then, we are trying to get [Audio Gap] in the cars slowly for the past few months.
     But we are just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we have built.
>>> But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.

But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Great.
     Thank you.
     So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
     Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
     We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
     So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
     So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
     In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
     The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
>>> It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
     For Model 3 to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
     In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
     When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year.
     So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
     I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
     Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
     This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever existed.
     And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, simply real-world artificial intelligence.
     And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 watts or 80 watts.
     So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that.
     This has got to fit into a smaller screen.
     And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we are finally getting rid of one of the last questions.
     Radar was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good.
