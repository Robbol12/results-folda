[Year Q1] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #1787, TSLA_Q1_2023] [PLAN]
     We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
     We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.
     It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
     And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
     How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
     Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?
     Elon Musk

Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
     And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think.
     And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
     So it will not be disappointed at all.
     It's amazing.
     Martin Viecha

Great.
     Thank you very much.
     And let's go to analyst questions.
     We'll start with Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
     Alex, go ahead and unmute.
     Alex Potter

Can you hear me?
     Martin Viecha

Yes.
     Elon Musk

Yes.

2. [Sentence #1120, TSLA_Q1_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I think, we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year.
     So, let’s see.
     Obviously, we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months.
     So, with two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly.
     Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially.
     So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories.
     And we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.
     So, we’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi.
     That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals.
     And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting.
     That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything.
     And so, it’s, I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.
     So, I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth.
>>> And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year.
     So, it’s basically -- once again, I’d like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I’d like to thank our suppliers who’ve really gone the extra mile.
     They -- we have an amazing supplier group, and I want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running.
     And we’re really at the early stage of that journey.
     We only crossed 1 million units in the past 12 months recently.
     And we are -- we aspire to head to 20 million units a year.
     So, we’re basically 5% along the way towards our goal.
     And we are growing very, very rapidly year-over-year.
     And we remain confident of exceeding 50% annual growth for the foreseeable future for basically several of the next years, I mean, so yes.
     And then, there’s, of course, Optimus, which I was surprised that people did not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program.
     The importance of Optimus will become apparent in coming years.
     Those who are insightful or listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business, worth more than FSD.
     That’s my firm belief.
     So -- and then, of course, insurance is growing well.

3. [Sentence #1683, TSLA_Q1_2023] [PILOT]
     But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
     In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.
     Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
     Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
     However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes.
     Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries.
     As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
     This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
     Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus.
     This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
     We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
     Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year.
     Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
>>> We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.
     And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
     To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
     I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And let's go to investor questions on say.com.
     The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
     What variables do you consider?
     How frequently do you review pricing?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
     Elon Musk

My apologies.
     Sorry, I was on mute.
     Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
     It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
-----
4. [Sentence #608, TSLA_Q1_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.
     So -- and then to be in sort of fairly high-volume production for the S in Q3 and to start delivering the Model X in Q3 as well.
     So I think as we ramp up, I think, probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high.
     So surely, it’s going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes.
     So probably, we are -- like we are going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week, perhaps, if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500.
     This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
     And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
>>> In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
     Thanks to everyone at Tesla who have made this year a huge success.
     Now on to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.
     Elon Musk

Okay.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     Thanks, Elon.
     So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiple records in the first quarter of 2021, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difficult of the year for many reasons.
     To summarize the quarter, I think, it’s best understood by three key items.
     First, we successfully launched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the first quarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market.
     Second, as Elon mentioned, although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet begun customer deliveries.
     The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningful headwind to free cash flows and profit generation.
-----
5. [Sentence #2285, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
     In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding.
     Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
     And we can open it up to Q&A.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Let's start with investor Q&A.
     The first question is, what is the status of 4680.
     What is the current output?
     Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Sure.
     4680 production increased about 18% to 20% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
>>> We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four lines in Phase 1, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp.
     Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases.
     So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is on Optimus.
     So what is the current status of Optimus?
     Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
     When do you expect to start mass production?
     Elon Musk

We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab.
     In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year.
     And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year.
     These are just guesses.
     As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.
     Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.

6. [Sentence #1666, TSLA_Q1_2023] [PILOT]
     We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
     Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.
     So, yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy.
     So, we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
     And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
     So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
     In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
     Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
     Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
     And yes, super appreciated.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And Zach has some remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
>>> I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.
     And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
     There's three main points I want to make.
     First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
     But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
     In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.

7. [Sentence #2400, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible.
     These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     We’ll talk about this more on August 8.
     But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet.
     And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.
     Lars Moravy

5 million cars?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Lars Moravy

A little less?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars.
     Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
     Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
     Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
     This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year.
     Of course, volume production is what matters.
     That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
     Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
     Elon already talked about that.
     So we’ll have to wait till August.

8. [Sentence #2284, TSLA_Q1_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%.
     The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis.
     We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner.
     The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.

9. [Sentence #1638, TSLA_Q1_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States.
     And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
     So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
     The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
     Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
>>> As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
     Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.
     This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
     And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
     There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year.
     And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
     So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.

10. [Sentence #1753, TSLA_Q1_2023] [PILOT]
     The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lower embodied energy.
     It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials.
     We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.
     Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility.
     On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathode building in Austin, with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarter with a target to produce first material before the end of the year.
     Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and the structural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatt hours per year.
     We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
     It's simpler.
     We'll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
     And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
     We made significant improvements in both areas.
     Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased 12% and [Indiscernible] peak rate increased by 20% and through yields improved by 20%.
     Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months.
>>> And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
     This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
     There's a lot of macro uncertainty.
     There's also headwinds and tailwinds.
     And this is basically a question I think that's asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
     And within costs, there's a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in the macro world.
     Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we're working on is around ramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
     And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the 4680 cell, which is an input into our Austin COGS.
     And so, as the 4680 program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
     A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
     It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.

     Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in iron phosphate lithium-ion cells.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     Let’s go to the next question from institutional investors which is, you have suggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in automotive production versus the first Model 3 line on a first-principles physics analysis.
     Where does Berlin sit relative to that limit?
     Elon Musk

I think we are still quite far away from it.
     I mean, the thing to bear in mind with production is for those who have never done production, they just don’t understand how insanely hard production is.
     I want to really be very, very emphatic here.
     Prototypes are trivial.
     They are child’s play.
     Production is hard.
     It is very hard.
     Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low-cost, insanely difficult.
     But what Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car.
>>> The truly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the first American car company to achieve volume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.
     So this is -- this -- basically myself and NIO and Tesla had to basically have several aneurysms to get this done.
     It was so hard.
     You have no idea.
     So anyway, and the thing about making a large complex manufactured object is let’s say that you have a closer approximation 10,000 unique items.
     If even one of those items is slow, that sets your rate, just one.
     Isn’t that so trivial?
     We have had a production stop because of carpet in the trunk.
     We had a production stop because of a USB cable.
     At one point for the Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics store in the Bay Area for a few days there.
     Nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because we went and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.
     And there are like hundreds of stories like that.
     So anyway, solving that, those constraints, and a logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial.
     I am not kidding.

     So taking all those things that we've replenished and applying to how HVAC would be and commercial HVAC would be is just very exciting.
     And then you've got – if you're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source, if you have water, you possibly could then heat the water and have a water heater as well.

Yeah.
     And use it as a heat source, if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoor is really cold or the other way around.
     So lots of options.
     Elon Musk

It could be a hell of a product.
     So we just have to – Tesla have potentially to whether we continue on the product front.
     So we're going to make sure, we got a lot of ice in the fire here, for new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts of the world and Model Y, Autopilot and the Solar Roof and…

Zachary Kirkhorn

New technologies.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     Powerwall, Powerpack, Megapack.
     We are seeing tremendous demand for stationary storage, more than we can supply, at least for 2020.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> And the last question from the retailers, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like Hornsdale Power Reserve and most lending instead of selling them battery storage?
     Does it make sense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?
     Elon Musk

Well, we haven't really thought about that yet.
     It's not out of the question, but our brand is full.
     Excuse me, sir, our brand is full.
     That's not out of the question.
     Our overarching goal is to help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.
     And the three elements of that are sustainable power generation, then you've got to store the power, stationary storage.
     And then you've got to have electric transportation.
     So -- and we don't have, like, say, specific market share goals or anything like that.
     It's just to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that's a fundamental good for the world, and we want to do that as fast as possible.
     But it's not, like you said, market share growth is a goal in and of itself.
     It's just the faster this happens, the better the world will do.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

13. [Sentence #1462, TSLA_Q1_2022] [UNCERTAIN]
     I mean, Zach, I don’t know -- I realize that’s problem, that’s for sure.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

The way we’ve been -- I think we have to take this one step at a time.
     And so, we have investments that are happening right now to get Austin and Berlin up and running.
     And then, as Elon mentioned, installing capacity for robotaxi production.
     And there are some decisions that, as Elon alluded to, just to share in the future about what the economic model looks like -- what the economic model looks like for robotaxi.
     And so, the way Elon and I have discussed this is [Technical Difficulty]

Elon Musk

Maybe just everyone [Technical Difficulty]

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     So, our focus is to get to the point where robotaxis are on the road, Optimus is in use, get the economic model for that dialed in, and then evaluate the size of cash flows at that point and make decisions then as to what’s next.
     Martin Viecha

Pierre, do you have a follow-up question?
     Pierre Ferragu

[Technical Difficulty]

Martin Viecha

All right.
     Let’s go to the next one.
     The next question comes from Trip Chowdhry from Global Equity Research.
     Trip Chowdhry

Thank you.
     Two questions I have.
>>> First is regarding the Cybertruck.
     And I was wondering like in terms of number of parts, how would Cybertruck compare with the traditional pickup truck in terms of number of parts?
     The second question I have is on Gigafactory Nevada, Sparks.
     Will we have any production of vehicles in that factory, or all the future production will happen in Giga Austin?
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

I’m not sure if we’ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts.
     I mean, Lars?
     Lars Moravy

Yes.
     I mean, if you want to go down the like -- it depends on what kind of part.
     We still have cells in [Technical Difficulty]

Elon Musk

Mention count.
     Lars Moravy

If we don’t count that, like the simplicity of our structure is significant versus a traditional pickup truck or any other vehicle, like as we’ve talked about their gigacastings, we save hundreds of parts there.
     Elon Musk

I mean, the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.
     Lars Moravy

So, with the Cybertruck and the doors, for example, we have an exoskeleton design where the door is ready to take and it takes all the long-term impact.
     So, we really have -- like we don’t have the door reinforcements.
-----
14. [Sentence #1636, TSLA_Q1_2023] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
     So just a Q1 recap.
     Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States.
     And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
     So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
     The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
     I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars.
     And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry.
     We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin.
     However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
     So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
     This is an extremely important point.
     Let's see.
>>> Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes.
     It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
     As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.
     So the Cybertruck is no different.
     So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously.
     And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
     But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
     And this is really a very radical product.
     It's not made in the way that other cars are made.
     So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress.
     Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1.
     This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
     And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
     There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year.
-----
15. [Sentence #595, TSLA_Q1_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     Obviously, people have heard about the chip shortage.
     This is a huge problem.
     But then in addition to that, for example, we had quite a difficulty scaling, driving our production in China, because we are unable to get critical engineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions.
     So - which meant that Tesla worldwide was dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada.
     So that was a very challenging situation.
     I think we are mostly out of that particular problem.
     But that’s just - those were just two of many challenges.
     So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chain shortages.
     So with respect to Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing the Plaid Model S or what we call the Paladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, which has a revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has, for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.
     There’s just a lot of issues encountered, ensuring that the new factory was as also we’re saying was quite hard, because [inaudible] in a smaller pace.
     So it took quite a bit of development to ensure that the battery of the new S/X is safe.
     Then, we are trying to get [Audio Gap] in the cars slowly for the past few months.
     But we are just stacking them up in the yard and just making refinements to the cars that we have built.
>>> But we do expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.
     So -- and then to be in sort of fairly high-volume production for the S in Q3 and to start delivering the Model X in Q3 as well.
     So I think as we ramp up, I think, probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high.
     So surely, it’s going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes.
     So probably, we are -- like we are going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week, perhaps, if we get lucky, upwards of 2,400 or 2,500.
     This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which just a lot of factors outside of our control here.
     But I do think we -- this will get solve, it’s just a matter of time, and then we will be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week.
     It actually costs us less to produce, a little bit less to produce.
     But it is a superior product.
     So in conclusion, there’s a lot to be excited about in 2021 and 2022.
     We are building factories as quickly as we can.
     Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well and we expect to have initial limited production from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.
     And at this time, we will continue to ramp production of Model Y in three months in Shanghai.
     In the background, we are continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, on the Roadster and other products.
-----
16. [Sentence #203, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PILOT]
     It's a little bit over $600 million.
     And so as we release features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have been released associated value and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our financials for that quarter.
     And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we can recognize that revenue.
     So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenue within period.
     So, I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful gross margin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.
     Elon Musk

Absolutely.
     There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the beat out there that could upgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving.
     And that's something we will enable just as simple in our purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of the year, as a subscription.
     So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.
     That's not in the deferred revenue line, obviously, but it's certainly a great deal deferred potential that we think is a large portion, which is likely to reach fruition.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And now let's go through the questions from retail investors.
     Question number one, Elon has mentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past.
>>> Is this still in line with Tesla's ambitions for the next five to 10 years?
     This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and more than 20 million vehicles in 2030.
     Is 40% or more realistic target?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be.
     I think people – actually people would have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with it sort of came out of nowhere.
     So I think in the absence of something, some massive force majeure events, but quite massive, I think, 40% is the likely number.
     It's possible that is 40%.
     I would be very shocked, if it's less than 40%, even with force majeure Model 3.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     The next question from retail investors.
     When will you announce the next Giga?
     How many Gigas, do you have planned for the next five years?
     Elon Musk

I think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month.
     We may not – as soon as next month.
-----
17. [Sentence #108, TSLA_Q1_2020] [PLAN]
     Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned and we're making progress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai.
     In the near term, our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows and profitability to the company.
     In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon as that's possible.
     We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.
     Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind to free cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2.
     Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locally producing and delivering vehicles.
     While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receiving many online orders, despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.
     However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term financial performance and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to ramp production to prior levels.
     More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows are managed appropriately.
     Working capital management, in particular, raw material inventory is the single most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time.
     The Tesla team has done a great job here.
     We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce non-critical expenses and optional investments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.
     Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to proceed fully with our most important, long-term investments.
>>> It is important to note that Tesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial work we've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.
     And we have the ability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.
     So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by Safe Technologies.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet to purchase or experience FSD, despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware.
     What levers could you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage?
     For example, could you consider offering FSD as a premium subscription?
     Elon Musk

I think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards the end of this year.
     I should say, it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as in our view, buying FSD is an investment in the future.
     And we are confident that it is investment that will pay off to the consumer -- to the benefit of the consumer.
     In my opinion, buying FSD option is something people will not regret doing.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Agree.
     And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in the vehicle or a lease is – will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preserve the option value of increased value of time.

18. [Sentence #438, TSLA_Q1_2020] [UNCERTAIN]
     Thank you.
     Elon Musk

No.
     I think this is set right through with the Panasonic relationship.
     I mean, I have a great relationship with Panasonic's CEO.
     We meet regularly one on one and talk at the time.
     So, that relationship is strong.
     Just that he'd bring more of a broader and a global, strategic view to the Board.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question, please.
     Operator

Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
     Please go ahead.
     Gene Munster

Congratulations on the progress.
     Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year.
>>> I would love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that's going to look prior to the robo taxi stage?
     Are you going to gradually take over human routes with autonomous capable routes over time?
     Or how do you see that playing out?
     Elon Musk

Well, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is, we'll release more and more functionality.
     Yes, before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing.
     First, we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.
     So we run any car changes through battery tests and simulation.
     Then we have a global QA team, which I'm on, actually.
     I'm one of -- on the global QA team.
     And we test the releases in the real world, the essence of real-world in a simulation, which is -- which are very many, because the world is very complex and where -- and then we release it to a small group of private beta testers within the company; then to a larger audience, including people outside the company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then finally, a broad release.
     And so there are many stages that these things go through.
     So, by the time something is being -- going to wide release into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages.
     And the software that's at the very early stage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.
     So, just going to go through a very rigorous safety process.

20. [Sentence #2217, TSLA_Q1_2024] [PLAN]
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
     So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont.
     There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
     We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
     Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
     It will increase.
     We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
     We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
     In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks.
>>> We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.
     These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.
     So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
     It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
     And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
     Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.
     It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America.
     So it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
     So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
     Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
     It's really how humans drive.
     Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
     So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
     To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out.

     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator Instructions]

But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Great.
     Thank you.
     So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.
     Tesla achieved record production, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the first time.
     We have seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles and our demand is the best we have ever seen.
     So this is – if you talk about, we are used to seeing a reduction in demand in the first quarter and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demand in Q1.
     So Model 3 became the best-selling mid-sized premier sedan in the world.
     In fact, I should say, the best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world.
     The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time best-selling premium sedan.
>>> It’s been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3, and this is only three-and-a half years into production and with just two factories.
     For Model 3 to be out selling its combustion engine competitors, I think, this is quite remarkable.
     In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly $0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates in an annualized rate of $0.5 million per year.
     When it comes to Model Y, we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind in the world, and probably, next year.
     So I am not 100% certain next year, but I think it’s quite likely.
     I’d say more likely than not that in 2022 Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.
     Then with regard to Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress.
     This is definitely one of the -- I think, one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that has maybe ever existed.
     And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty significant part of artificial intelligence, simply real-world artificial intelligence.
     And that sort of AI, the neural net needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efficient computer that was designed, but nonetheless, a small computer that’s using on the order of 70 watts or 80 watts.
     So this is a much harder problem than if you were to use, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or something like that.
     This has got to fit into a smaller screen.
     And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we are finally getting rid of one of the last questions.
     Radar was really -- it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision, but this is not good.
