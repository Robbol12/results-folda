    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
    Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
    But I&#x27;m just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our
suppliers.
    It is to supplement our suppliers.
    And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is 
simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
    So it&#x27;s an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
    And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of 
Tesla is just what&#x27;s the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue 
probably one level.
    And that&#x27;s how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.

Thank you very much.
    The next question is about <span class="r2">4680</span> cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck </span>
<span class="r5">development?</span>
    What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in <span class="r2">2021</span>?
    Elon Musk

All right.
    So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
    So we&#x27;re no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
    We&#x27;ve got the designs fixed.
    We&#x27;re getting to – we&#x27;ll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
    We&#x27;re actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you&#x27;ve got – 
obviously, it&#x27;s a bigger vehicle and you&#x27;ve got a long truck bed that&#x27;s going to a lot of load.
    So we&#x27;ll be using an <span class="r2">8</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to <span class="r2">6</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons for Model Y.
    So <span class="r2">6</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons was the biggest cast in the world.
    <span class="r2">8</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
    And I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible vehicle.
    If we get lucky, we&#x27;ll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production 
to be in <span class="r2">2022</span>.

    Operator

Thank you.
    Our first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
    Please go ahead.
    Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
    Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you&#x27;re seeing that play out?
    Obviously, it&#x27;s a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are really in the way here, but we&#x27;d love to 
understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the rollout of FSD throughout the balance of
this year and into next year?

    And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company&#x27;s long-term earnings power is
tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
    Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending 
on what you assume for pack size on Elon&#x27;s <span class="r2">20</span> million vehicle unit goal?
    Elon Musk

Yeah.
    It is.
    So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
    What&#x27;s the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
    And you can&#x27;t grow faster than that.
    Now at Tesla, we&#x27;ve improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range
even with the standard range battery pack.
    It&#x27;s in the high -- it&#x27;s approaching -- for Model <span class="r2">3</span>, it&#x27;s approaching the high 200s.
    And some slight continued improvements, we&#x27;ll start to get to a <span class="r2">300</span>-mile range even with standard pack and an order 
<span class="r2">500</span> kilometers.
    So there&#x27;s efficiency improvements in the car.
    But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
    And there&#x27;s, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.</span>
    It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
    In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
    And we&#x27;ve been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many 
batteries as they can produce.
    So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
