start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">52</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span class="r2">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
    We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we
are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.
    If you have got to be – the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner, but because we have 
vision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with <span class="r2">100</span>% probability before it actually happens.
    And so we can tension the seatbelts and we can even adjust the airbag deployment, because we can see, not just feel.
    This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer.
    And there is also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have at least 
AP3 hardware.
    In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Our team continues to focus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design.</span>
    We are expecting to be – still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year.
    And we are very, very excited about that product.
    I think it might actually be our best product ever.
    Let’s see.
    And FSD beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end of this year.
    And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we will also be releasing it hopefully in Europe and some other parts 
of the world.
    We are hosting our AI Day in a few months.
    I think people will be amazed at what we are able to show off in AI Day.
    So basically, there is a tremendous amount to look forward to in the second half of this year.
    And I want to thank all of our employees and suppliers for their super hard work during these challenging times.
    Super appreciate it.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

    And Zach has some opening remarks as well.

<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">292</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    We’ve grown cell production significantly on a <span class="r2">12</span>-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our 
partners for key battery metals.
    So we don’t see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add on the profitability part of the question.
    Q2 was our largest increase yet over the last handful of quarters on inflation and commodity-related increases to 
our cars.
    It’s fairly evenly spread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supply
chain.
    So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year.
    It ticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2.
    So as we look through to the end of the year, what we’re seeing is we don’t think the inflation-related increases in
Q3 will be as big as Q2.
    But as Elon had mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.
    And we don’t have full exposure, as Karan had just mentioned, on every component of cost because we do have some 
contracts in place.
    But there are some spot buys as well and some contracts being renegotiated.
    So we’re managing it with pricing and in partnership with our suppliers but it does continue to be something that is
impacting our financials.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the last question is, when will the Cybertruck be officially available?</span>
    Elon Musk

We’re hoping to start delivering them in the middle of next year.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to analyst questions.
    The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
    Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.
    Pierre Ferragu

Hi, guys.
    Thanks for taking my question.
    I’d like to ask like a question on <span class="r2">4680</span> and the structural battery pack.
    And I’d love to understand where you stand on the technology and efficiency and energy density road map that you 
described at the Battery Day.
    So what I’m trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of the battery cell itself?
    How much silicon do you have in it?
    How much energy improvement have you achieved already so far?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">44</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So – and that mileage is growing exponentially.
    With regard to manufacturing and technology, about <span class="r2">5</span> or <span class="r2">6</span> years ago, we said we wanted to become the best 
manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, will actually be, I think, our 
strongest competitive advantage.
    We are super pro-manufacturing here at Tesla.
    And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing.
    And in general, I think it is a very important thing to do.
    We need to make stuff and make it efficiently and that’s manufacturing.
    So we’ve made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes.
    As we now show in the shareholder deck, thanks to our – the large castings, we make the world’s largest castings.
    We reduced body welding robot count by <span class="r2">70</span>% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin.
    So that’s, call it, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case.
    And I should say it’s also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness.
    So, it’s good on every level.
    But this journey is not over.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We will bring another level of simplicity and manufacturing improvements with Cybertruck and future products that we</span>
<span class="r4">are not quite ready to talk about now, but I think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.</span>
    Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detects imminent collision,
which has never been done before.
    So, you can imagine that if you have a seatbelt that only tensions upon impact you have very little time to tension 
the seatbelt.

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">329</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Maybe another way of putting it is that the – our focus right now is on the dozens of little issues that inhibit the
production ramp of the <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    Some of the more challenging ones have been feeding the anode-cathode material because we’re using this 
revolutionary dry electrode process.
    But when something is revolutionary, it’s a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved.
    So we’re confident of resolving those unknowns but it’s very difficult.
    It’s – yes, we’re making rapid progress on that point.
    So the first order of business is really get the basics right, get to high volume and high reliability and then very
rapidly iterate within that to enhance the energy density and reduce the cost of the cell.
    Andrew Baglino

Totally agree, yes.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    Elon Musk

I’d say we are highly confident of a good outcome.
    It’s the exact counterpoint of that is perhaps is of some debate but the outcome is not.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes.
    Specific to the dry process, we made a major advance this past quarter in Kato that the team is really excited 
about, and congrats to the team for achieving that.
    Elon Musk

But I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of battery cells.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do.</span>
    And we want our suppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire 
supply chain.
    The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you grow with the amount 
battery output per year?
    This is the fundamental rate limiter for transition to sustainability because you need the batteries for two of the 
pillars of sustainability, the stationary storage and for vehicles.
    So yes.
    Andrew Baglino

Yes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarily scalable.
    I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I’ve seen.
    And so like focusing on them is a distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as 
possible?
    And we’re taking these risks that we’ve discussed at Battery Day.
    And our plan is as we de-risk them and they are successful, we want to bring them back to our partners so that they 
can go faster, too, because that’s all on the mission, right, like how do we accelerate.
    Elon Musk

People often ask me, if you often ask me, is some breakthrough needed in battery technology for the world to transition 
to sustainability?
    The answer is no.
    Even if there was zero technology breakthroughs, so literally zero from where the technology is right now, we could 
fully transition Earth to sustainable energy.
    The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain from mining to refining to cell production.
