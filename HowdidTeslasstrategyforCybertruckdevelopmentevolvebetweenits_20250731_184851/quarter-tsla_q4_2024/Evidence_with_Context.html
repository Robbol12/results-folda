    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q4_2024]</span> How did Tesla&#x27;s strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its <span class="r2">2019</span> unveiling and its production 
start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">302</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The line after that would be for <span class="r2">100</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units a month.
    And I think probably with Version <span class="r2">2</span>, it is a very rough guess because there&#x27;s so much uncertainty here, very rough 
guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next 
year, something like that.
    But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one&#x27;s receiving humanoid robots to these 
things like coming out like crazy.
    We can&#x27;t build enough.
    We&#x27;re always going to be in the -- we can&#x27;t build enough situation.
    Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
    And then I said like, once we start -- once we&#x27;re at a steady state of above <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year, I think the 
production -- I&#x27;m confident at <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $<span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of 
Optimus is much less than a car.
    So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over <span class="r2">1</span> million units a year, that you&#x27;d see 
Optimus be, I don&#x27;t know, half the cost or something like that.
    What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
    The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?</span>
    And how will it impact revenue and scale?
    Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.
    So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the 
weather.
    In Reno, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
    But we&#x27;re prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
    The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in <span class="r2">2025</span> and begin ramping early in <span class="r2">2026</span>.
    But as we&#x27;ve said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
    I think it&#x27;s really similar to Optimus.
    It&#x27;s going to be set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it&#x27;s much, much cheaper than any
other transportation you could have.
    So, at that point, when we&#x27;re at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla&#x27;s revenue.
    Might be difficult to say how much.
    you want to add.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

No.

    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla&#x27;s fourth quarter <span class="r2">2024</span> q&amp;a webcast.
    My name is Travis Axelrod, the here at Tesla.
    And I&#x27;m joined today by Elon Musk and Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives.
    Our Q4 results were announced at about <span class="r7">3:00</span> p.m.

Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
    During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
    These comments are based on predictions and expectations as of today.
    Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those 
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
    During the question-and-answer portion of today&#x27;s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
    <span class="r8">[</span>Operator instructions<span class="r8">]</span> Before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
    So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly <span class="r2">2</span> million a year.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.</span>
    Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Where to invest $<span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> right now
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
    After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">040</span>% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to <span class="r2">182</span>% for 
the S&amp;P <span class="r2">500</span>.
    They just revealed what they believe are the <span class="r2">10</span> best stocks for investors to buy right now…

*Stock Advisor returns as of July <span class="r2">21</span>, <span class="r2">2025</span>

That&#x27;s worth noting.
    Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, No.
    <span class="r2">1</span> was Model Y.
    We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don&#x27;t know what -- really, I was going
to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it&#x27;s like autonomy is like 1<span class="r2">0x</span>-ing frankly.
    Doubling is not even enough.
    We made many critical investments in <span class="r2">2024</span> in manufacturing, AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the 
future, immense.
    Like it&#x27;s, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.
    And I&#x27;ve said this before and I&#x27;ll stand by it.
    I see a path.
    I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s an easy path but I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far.
