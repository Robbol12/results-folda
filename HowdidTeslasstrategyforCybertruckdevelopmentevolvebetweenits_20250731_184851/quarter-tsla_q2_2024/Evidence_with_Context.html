start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.
    I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
    So next year seems highly probable to me based on  <span class="r5">(</span>ph<span class="r5">)</span> plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention.
    That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
    Travis Axelrod

Thank you very much.
    Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it.
    Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
    Elon Musk

I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather 
than earnings calls.
    Travis Axelrod

Great, thank you.
    Our next question is, what is the current status of <span class="r2">4680</span> battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
    Lars Moravy

Yes, <span class="r2">4680</span> production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering <span class="r2">51</span>% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly.
    We currently produce more than <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">400</span> Cybertrucks of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells per week, and we&#x27;ll continue to ramp output as we 
drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is</span>
<span class="r6">a huge technical milestone and we&#x27;re super proud of that.</span>
    We&#x27;re on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly 
below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the <span class="r2">4680</span> program.
    Travis Axelrod

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is any update on Dojo?
    Elon Musk

Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I&#x27;m incredibly impressed by NVIDIA&#x27;s execution and the capability of their
hardware.
    And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it&#x27;s often difficult to get the GPUs.
    And there just seems this, I guess I&#x27;m quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs
when we want them.
    And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have -- in order to ensure 
that we&#x27;ve got the training capability that we need.
    So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo.
    And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the -- it&#x27;s obviously their 
obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high.
    So, I think we&#x27;ve really got to make Dojo work and we will.
    Travis Axelrod

Right.
    The next question is what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">41</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old.
    So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with <span class="r2">12.5</span>, we are finally merged the two stacks.
    I still find that most people actually don&#x27;t know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand
the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around.
    One of the things we&#x27;re going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car 
is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them
around the block.
    Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it.
    So it&#x27;s very compelling.
    And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand 
driver.
    And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to 
unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in <span class="r5">[</span>V3<span class="r5">]</span> <span class="r5">(</span>ph<span class="r5">)</span>.
    We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 
<span class="r2">10</span>/<span class="r2">10</span> to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle --
sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a 
couple of other things.
    So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the 
product unveil.
    We&#x27;re also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to
date.
    So it will be an incremental for <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> H100s plus <span class="r2">20</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> of our hardware <span class="r2">4</span> AI5 Tesla AI computer.
    With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we expect to have Optimus production Version </span><span class="r6">1</span><span class="r6"> in limited production starting early next year.</span>
    This will be for Tesla consumption.
    It&#x27;s just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves.
    But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in 
the Tesla factories.
    And then in <span class="r2">2026</span>, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we&#x27;ll be providing Optimus robots to outside 
customers.
    That will be Production Version <span class="r2">2</span> of Optimus.
    For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else.
    This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
    So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should 
roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially.
    So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board.
    We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
    The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright.
    I really just can&#x27;t emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus.
    Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the 
fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet.
<span class="r7">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">208</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    At Tesla, we had no place to try them on, so it would&#x27;ve been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to
order H100 and have no place to try them on.
    So it was just -- there was -- this wasn&#x27;t a, let&#x27;s pick xAI of Tesla.
    There&#x27;s -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full.
    There was no place to actually put them.
    The -- we&#x27;ve been working <span class="r2">24</span>/<span class="r2">7</span> to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas.
    That South extension is what will house <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> H100s and we&#x27;re beginning to move the H100 server racks into place 
there.
    But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically.
    You can&#x27;t just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it&#x27;s not possible.
    So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla&#x27;s interest, not contrary to Tesla&#x27;s interest.
    Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can&#x27;t turn on.
    That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week.
    We are moving the GPUs in there and we&#x27;ll bring them online.
    With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI </span>
<span class="r6">and not on Tesla&#x27;s specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.</span>
    So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not 
involved.
    Those are the two choices.
    This wasn&#x27;t they would come to Tesla.
    They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances.
    So, yes.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full 
time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there&#x27;s the other spectrum of AI which we&#x27;re not working on, and that&#x27;s the 
kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
    So you have to keep that in mind that it&#x27;s a broad spectrum.
    It&#x27;s not just one specific thing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And once again, I want to just repeat myself here.
    I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say like, you can work on AGI, I if you want and they refused.
    Only then was xAI created.
    Will Stein

I really appreciate that clarification.

    Elon Musk

With respect to Roadster, we&#x27;ve completed most of the engineering.
    And I think there&#x27;s still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next 
year.
    It will be something special, like the whole thing <span class="r5">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r5">]</span>.
    Travis Axelrod

Fantastic.
    The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we&#x27;ve already covered.
    So we&#x27;ll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
    Elon Musk

I guess that, that&#x27;s really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full 
self-driving.
    It&#x27;s difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.
    So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high 
enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year.

    These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs.
    We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world.
    This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car.
    We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well.
    On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially.
    It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of 
vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
    We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further 
localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories.
    As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price.
    We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than <span class="r2">300</span> miles on a single 
charge.
    We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range 
anxiety.
    Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we&#x27;ve seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect 
this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further.
    Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck.
    While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such 
reductions would show up in the P&amp;L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered.
<span class="r6">&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping </span>
<span class="r6">Cybertruck and Model </span><span class="r6">3</span><span class="r6"> and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished </span>
<span class="r6">goods.</span>
    While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the 
near-term.
    We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was 
laid over time is bearing the expected results.
    Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting
in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
    Energy storage backlog is strong.
    As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and 
others seeing a decline.
    Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send 
units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction 
activities.
    Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the 
improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
    The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement.
    Just to level set, this was about $<span class="r2">622</span> million of charge, which got recorded in the period.
    And I want people to remember that we&#x27;ve called it out separately on the financials.
    Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related 
activities and higher legal and other costs.
    On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $<span class="r2">10</span> billion in 
CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online.
    This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives.

    On the auto business front, affordability remains a top of mind for customers, and in response in Q2, we offered
