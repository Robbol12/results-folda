start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">88</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span class="r2">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient 
manner.
    The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and 
ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.
    In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely 
rewarding.
    Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.
    And we can open it up to Q&amp;A.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s start with investor Q&amp;A.
    The first question is, what is the status of <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    What is the current output?
    Lars?
    Lars Moravy

Sure.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> production increased about <span class="r2">18</span>% to <span class="r2">20</span>% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about <span class="r2">7</span> 
gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four </span>
<span class="r5">lines in Phase </span><span class="r5">1</span><span class="r5">, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we&#x27;re ahead of the ramp.</span>
    Because we&#x27;re ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the 
lines and production volume increases.
    So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is on Optimus.
    So what is the current status of Optimus?
    Are they currently performing any factory tasks?
    When do you expect to start mass production?
    Elon Musk

We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab.
    In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful 
tasks before the end of this year.
    And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year.
    These are just guesses.
    As I&#x27;ve said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.
    Because if you&#x27;ve got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is 
no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">203</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible.
    These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our 
capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We’ll talk about this more on August <span class="r2">8</span>.
    But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that
autonomy for a gigantic fleet.
    And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do 
unsupervised full self-driving.
    Lars Moravy

<span class="r2">5</span> million cars?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Lars Moravy

A little less?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    It will be <span class="r2">7</span> million cars in a year or so and then <span class="r2">10</span> million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of 
millions of cars.
    Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?</span>
    Lars Moravy

I can take that one too.
    Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago.
    This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP  late last year.
    Of course, volume production is what matters.
    That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so 
many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost 
efficiency and quality.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you.
    The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
    Elon Musk

We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is about the robotaxi unveil.
    Elon already talked about that.
    So we’ll have to wait till August.

    As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our
head count by over <span class="r2">10</span>%.
    The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $<span class="r2">1</span> billion on an annual run rate basis.
    We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient

    Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
    But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks.
    Elon?
    Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
    So to recap, in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont.
    There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto 
manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.
    We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.
    Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage 
deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy 
business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.
    It will increase.
    We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected.
    We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially.
    In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in 
the past several weeks.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup </span>
<span class="r5">production in the second half of </span><span class="r5">2025</span><span class="r5">, so we expect it to be more like the early </span><span class="r5">2025</span><span class="r5">, if not late this year.</span>
    These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as 
aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle 
lineup.
    So it&#x27;s not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.
    It&#x27;ll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.
    And we think this should allow us to get to over <span class="r2">3</span> million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent.
    Regarding FSD Version <span class="r2">12</span>, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven&#x27;t experienced this, I strongly urge 
you to try it out.
    It&#x27;s profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we&#x27;ve now turned that on for all cars with the cameras 
and inference computer and everything from Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> on in North America.
    So it&#x27;s been pushed out to, I think, around <span class="r2">1.8</span> million vehicles and we&#x27;re seeing about half of people use it so far
and that percentage is increasing with each passing week.
    So, we now have over <span class="r2">300</span> billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.
    Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it&#x27;s become very clear that the vision-based 
approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy.
    It&#x27;s really how humans drive.
    Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.
    So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.
    To make it more accessible, we&#x27;ve reduced the subscription price to $<span class="r2">99</span> a month, so it&#x27;s easy to try out.
