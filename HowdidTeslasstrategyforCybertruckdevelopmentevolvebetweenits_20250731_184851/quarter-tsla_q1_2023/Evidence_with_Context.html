start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">175</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement.
    We think there&#x27;ll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but<span class="r4">...</span>

Elon Musk

Lithium has dropped a lot.
    It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    And that&#x27;s the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2.
    And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the 
second half of the year.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

So this is our approach.
    How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we&#x27;ll have to see how the year progresses.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
    Elon Musk

I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new </span>
<span class="r5">features that will make it to production?</span>
    Elon Musk

Well, I think we&#x27;ll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year.
    And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it&#x27;s an incredible product, it&#x27;s a hall of famer, I think.
    And a product like this only comes once in a long while.
    So it will not be disappointed at all.
    It&#x27;s amazing.
    Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to analyst questions.
    We&#x27;ll start with Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
    Alex, go ahead and unmute.
    Alex Potter

Can you hear me?
    Martin Viecha

Yes.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and 
deliveries.
    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.
    We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter.
    Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we&#x27;re operating the business this year.
    Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, </span>
<span class="r5">in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products.</span>
    And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading.
    To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding 
the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic.
    I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And let&#x27;s go to investor questions on say.com.
    The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments?
    What variables do you consider?
    How frequently do you review pricing?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
    Elon Musk

My apologies.
    Sorry, I was on mute.
    Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.
    It&#x27;s just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">54</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    We&#x27;re -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has.
    Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to 
achieving an incredible outcome.
    So, yes, so we&#x27;re also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting
factors of achieving full autonomy.
    So, we&#x27;re continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort 
into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training.
    And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in 
the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.
    So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.
    In conclusion, we&#x27;re taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.
    Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we&#x27;ll 
continue to invest in growth as fast as possible.
    Once again, I&#x27;d like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again.
    And yes, super appreciated.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And Zach has some remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Thanks Martin.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries.</span>
    And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.
    There&#x27;s three main points I want to make.
    First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially.
    But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels.
    In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call,
which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, 
most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot 
features as we transition technologies.
    Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of 
some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized.
    Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes.
    However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and 
stabilize at our intended volumes.
    Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and

    As I&#x27;ve mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher 
volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows.
    This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.
    Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment 
and focus.
    This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company&#x27;s revenue and reached its highest level 
yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products.

<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">26</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r8">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United 
States.
    And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery.
    So it&#x27;s a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results.
    The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain.
    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as 
cars.
    And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it&#x27;s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the 
best in the industry.
    We&#x27;ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume
and higher margin.
    However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy.
    So we do believe we&#x27;re like laying the groundwork here, and then it&#x27;s better to ship a large number of cars at a 
lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy.
    This is an extremely important point.
    Let&#x27;s see.
    Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing 
purposes.
    It&#x27;s a great product, and we&#x27;re completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we&#x27;re 
anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates.</span>
    So the Cybertruck is no different.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> amount of demand for the product, obviously.
    And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer.
    But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going.
    And this is really a very radical product.
    It&#x27;s not made in the way that other cars are made.
    So with regard to Megapack, we&#x27;re making great progress.
    Our energy storage deployment reached nearly <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours in Q1.
    This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.
    And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California.
    There&#x27;s still some way to go to reach the <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> rate of <span class="r2">40</span> gigawatt hours per year.
    And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai.
    So we&#x27;re -- as we&#x27;ve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">141</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r7">[PILOT]</span>
    The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic 
reagents, lower embodied energy.
    It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials.
    We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.
    Same with cathode precursor, we&#x27;ve successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process 
that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this
technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility.
    On cathode production, we are <span class="r2">50</span>% equipment and <span class="r2">75</span>% utilities installed at our new cathode building in Austin, with 
our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarter with a target to produce first material before
the end of the year.
    Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell and the structural pack concept,
<span class="r2">50</span>% lower CapEx and <span class="r2">66</span>% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatt hours per year.
    We do believe structural as a concept is a good one.
    It&#x27;s simpler.
    We&#x27;ll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the 
design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.
    And zooming out for the <span class="r2">4680</span> team, Q1 was all about cost and quality.
    We made significant improvements in both areas.
    Texas production increased <span class="r2">50</span>% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased <span class="r2">12</span>% and <span class="r9">[</span>Indiscernible<span class="r9">]</span> peak rate 
increased by <span class="r2">20</span>% and through yields improved by <span class="r2">20</span>%.
    Altogether, the team accomplished a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve 
steady-state cost targets over the next <span class="r2">12</span> months.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the </span><span class="r5">4680</span><span class="r5"> program as we steadily </span>
<span class="r5">ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.</span>
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, what do you anticipate <span class="r2">2023</span> automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company&#x27;s 
current pricing levels?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can start off on this one.
    This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this.
    There&#x27;s a lot of macro uncertainty.
    There&#x27;s also headwinds and tailwinds.
    And this is basically a question I think that&#x27;s asking about viewpoint on where costs will go.
    And within costs, there&#x27;s a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we&#x27;re kind of subject to
what&#x27;s going on in the macro world.
    Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we&#x27;re working on is around ramping our Austin 
factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there.
    And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, which is an input into 
our Austin COGS.
    And so, as the <span class="r2">4680</span> program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell 
portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.
    A similar story exists in the Berlin factory.
    It does not have <span class="r2">4680</span> as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
