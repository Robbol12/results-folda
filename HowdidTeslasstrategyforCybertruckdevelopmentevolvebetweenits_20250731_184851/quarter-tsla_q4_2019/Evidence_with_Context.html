start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">41</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span class="r2">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span class="r2">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
    This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
    And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it&#x27;s really just an incredible specs all around.
    For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went 
viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how 
such product should look.
    So it really just from the standpoint of what&#x27;s the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks 
the ass of any pickup truck, basically that&#x27;s the goal.
    And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand 
has been incredible.
    I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we&#x27;ve never seen anything like it basically.
    I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
    So -- as many -- we&#x27;ll sell as many as we can make, it&#x27;s going to be pretty nuts.
    So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don&#x27;t even have enough information to 
realize just the awesomeness of it, it&#x27;s just great.
    So and then stepping back in <span class="r2">2018</span> from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in <span class="r2">2019</span> we 
managed to generate more than $<span class="r2">1</span> billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while 
building parts of Model Y in production.
    So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while 
developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of
the Tesla team and I&#x27;m just so proud to work with such a great team.
    I&#x27;d like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to 
this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we&#x27;ve got Model Y, we&#x27;ve </span>
<span class="r4">got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the </span>
<span class="r4">full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we&#x27;ll  too.</span>
    It&#x27;s hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
    So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next <span class="r2">10</span> years.
    If you look back <span class="r2">10</span> years from today to <span class="r2">2010</span>, we will produce approximately a <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> times more cars in <span class="r2">2020</span> then we 
produced in <span class="r2">2010</span>, <span class="r2">8</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
    So where we will be in <span class="r2">10</span> years, very excited to consider the prospect.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks, Martin.
    This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this 
happen.
    On <span class="r2">2019</span> a few key points I&#x27;d like to highlight.
    On demand, while we&#x27;ve mentioned a few times, it&#x27;s worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we&#x27;ve 
transitioned entirely from generating Model <span class="r2">3</span> orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
    We&#x27;ve also seen a stabilization of Model <span class="r2">3</span> ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we&#x27;ve seen an increase in ASPs of
S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
    With respect to capacity expansion, we&#x27;ve greatly learned from the development and launch of Model <span class="r2">3</span> in Fremont and 
Reno.
    As a result, we&#x27;ve been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">31</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Deliveries reached over <span class="r2">112</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> vehicles in a single quarter.
    It&#x27;s hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $<span class="r2">20</span> billion in 
revenue with zero advertising spend.
    I think that&#x27;s like where we do say that from time-time and I think it&#x27;s often overlooked, but to have the highest 
demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of 
the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of 
advertising.
    At our Fremont factory we&#x27;re producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 
<span class="r2">2006</span> and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
    This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there&#x27;s lot of 
potential to go beyond that number.
    For the Shanghai factory I&#x27;d like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model <span class="r2">3</span> last 
quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.
    I&#x27;m really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in 
Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
    Regarding Model Y, it was only <span class="r2">10</span> months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
    And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
    Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy 
efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at <span class="r2">4.1</span> miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got 
EPA rating of <span class="r2">315</span> miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.

<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">270</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the <span class="r2">10</span>-K, but back to the growth 
rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support 
that growth.
    So that helps.
    And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to 
continue to fund additional factory.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our  a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that 
Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.
    Operator

Our next question comes from .
    Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
    First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
    Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those 
Cybertrucks?
    Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don&#x27;t comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make
in the space of, I don&#x27;t know, three or four years, something like that.
    So the thing we&#x27;re going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that&#x27;s very 
fundamental because if you don&#x27;t improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one
product to another and you haven&#x27;t actually produced more electric vehicles.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it </span>
<span class="r4">does use a lot of cells and unless we&#x27;ve got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating </span>
<span class="r4">production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4"> or Model Y cars.</span>
    So we&#x27;ve got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost 
per kilowatt of the batteries.
    This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
    So that we said we&#x27;re going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans 
are.
    I think probably it&#x27;s going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it&#x27;s going to be
kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
    So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges 
are, how do you get from here to, I don&#x27;t know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
    Unidentified Analyst

Great.
    I&#x27;ll look forward to that Battery Day.
    Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not 
announced for Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that 
project?
    Elon Musk

Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery capacity otherwise we add complexity, but 
we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
    So what we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the 
batteries to make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet.
    And it&#x27;s just generally true when I see some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, whether pointing 
out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the 
average number of occupants in a car, I think is like <span class="r2">1.2</span> and maybe with autonomy maybe it will go to <span class="r2">1.4</span> maybe, but I&#x27;m
not sure if that -- it even goes there.
    So, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or something like probably, 
but like I said we&#x27;re going to solve those battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people 
cannot even balance today, that&#x27;s the real problem.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
