[Year Q4] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #31]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) For the **Cybertruck**, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the **Cybertruck**, and that was -- that went viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such product should look.
2. [Sentence #41]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, **Cybertruck** some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
3. [Sentence #270]  (TSLA_Q4_2019) So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated **production** of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating **production** of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model 3 or Model Y cars.
4. [Sentence #735]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell **production** is in order to accelerate the growth.
5. [Sentence #749]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in **Cybertruck** **development**?
6. [Sentence #750]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) What are your expectations for **Cybertruck** deliveries in 2021?
7. [Sentence #755]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the **Cybertruck** work.
8. [Sentence #756]  (TSLA_Q4_2020) We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of **Cybertruck** because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
9. [Sentence #1022]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
10. [Sentence #1067]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, **Cybertruck**, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to **production** hopefully next year.
11. [Sentence #1272]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for **Cybertruck** volume **production** besides battery shortage?
12. [Sentence #1273]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in **Cybertruck** **production**.
13. [Sentence #1274]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) There's a lot of new technology in the **Cybertruck** that will take some time to work through.
14. [Sentence #1278]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) I worry more about like how do we the **Cybertruck** affordable despite having awesome technology.
15. [Sentence #1280]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like **Cybertruck** to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
16. [Sentence #1444]  (TSLA_Q4_2021) If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and **Cybertruck** in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
17. [Sentence #1610]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) This includes expanding in-house cell **production**, bringing **Cybertruck** to market, **development** of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
18. [Sentence #1626]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing **production** credits for battery cells packs?
19. [Sentence #1694]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of **Cybertruck**.
20. [Sentence #1702]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) And to be clear, for 2023, **Cybertruck** will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year.
21. [Sentence #1751]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) The next question from investors is, is **Cybertruck** **production** still on track for mid-year?
22. [Sentence #1752]  (TSLA_Q4_2022) Elon Musk

We do expect **production** to **start**, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
23. [Sentence #2047]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023.
24. [Sentence #2148]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) Given that you moved the **start** of the next-generation compact vehicle **production** to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
25. [Sentence #2151]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) But our current schedule shows that we will **start** **production** towards the end of 2025.
26. [Sentence #2169]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will **start** **production** next year.
27. [Sentence #2249]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) When will Tesla **start** construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
28. [Sentence #2500]  (TSLA_Q4_2023) To what extent do you think **Cybertruck** is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
29. [Sentence #2638]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record **production** and deliveries.
30. [Sentence #2927]  (TSLA_Q4_2024) The next question is, what is the status on mass **production** of the Tesla Semi?
