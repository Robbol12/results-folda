[Year Q4] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023–2024?

1. [Sentence #1610, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
     As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
     There are three key points I wanted to make here.
     First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
     Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
     In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where efficiencies are the highest.
     But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.
     This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.
     As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.
     In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
     Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
     However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
     Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
>>> This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.
     We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
     Thank you.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
     I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
-----
2. [Sentence #1751, TSLA_Q4_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
     So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.
     So it's giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
     They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
     But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
     And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
     And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive.
     But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
     So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
     It's extremely expensive.
     And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
     So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
>>> The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?
     Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
     But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
     It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
     So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production.
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
     Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
-----
3. [Sentence #1272, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We might be able to do that by the end of the year, starting to get work on Europe by the end of the year.
     We'll have to see how we progress in the U.S.

Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your current factories, Freemont, Shanghai, Berlin and Austin?
     And timing for new factory announcements?
     Elon Musk

I don't think we want to comment on -- like that's -- it's always possible to increase the output of any given factory, to say, what's the next capacity?
     Well, it's difficult to say what that next capacity is because you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot.
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
>>> Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
     I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
-----
4. [Sentence #749, TSLA_Q4_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
>>> So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development?
     What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
     Elon Musk

All right.
     So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
     So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
     We've got the designs fixed.
     We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
     We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
     So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.
     So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
     8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
     And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
     If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.

     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
-----
6. [Sentence #1067, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.
     So, both last year and this year, if we were to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease.
     This is a very important point that I think people do not -- a lot of people do not understand.
     So, last year, we spent a lot of engineering and management resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducing the number of chips we need, with chip drama central.
     And that was not the only supply chain issue.
     So there's just hundreds of things.
     And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while at least almost every other manufacturer contracted last year.
     So, that's a good result.
     But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, we would -- our total vehicle output would have been the same because of the constraints -- the chips constraints, particularly.
     So, if we'd actually introduced an additional product, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity of the additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.
     And the same is true of this year.
     So, we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year.
     It would not make any sense because we'll still be part constrained.
>>> We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling and whatnot to create those vehicles, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring those to production hopefully next year.
     That is most likely.
     But like I said, it is dependent on, are we able to produce more cars or fewer cars?
     So, in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot.
     This, I think, has the potential to be more significant than the vehicle business over time.
     If you think about the economy, it is -- the foundation of the economy is labor.
     Capital equipment is distilled labor.
     So, what happens if you don't actually have a labor shortage?
     I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point.
     That's what Optimus is about.
     So, very important.
     Drew, you want to talk about the 4680 program, or is this a good, right time?
     Andrew Baglino

Yes, yes.
     Sure.
-----
7. [Sentence #1702, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Thanks, Martin.
     First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
     It was no small feat.
     Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
     As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
     Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
>>> And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year.
     So it's an incredible product.
     I can't wait to drive it personally.
     It will be the car that I drive every day.
     I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
     And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.
     So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed.
     Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human.
     So what we're aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let's say, for argument's sake if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%.
     It will be Hardware 5 beyond that.
     But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
     But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant.
     So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.

     We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner.
     Certainly, we're happy to, except on the supercharger front.
     We're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our supercharger network.
     We're also happy to license full self-driving, perhaps license other technologies, and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you for taking the questions.
     First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform.
     You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain.
     Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
     And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries.
>>> To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don't think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
     We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
     When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
     You don't just throw it on the line and just build it.
     So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
     Sure, 48 volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well.
     We're also open to partnering.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     48 volts.
     Lars Moravy

On that if everyone wants to do that.
     Elon Musk

Certainly.
     Man, the people that really know that this is like the inside baseball thing.
     But man, 48, it's so high time that the water industry moved from the 12 -- the random number of 12 volts to 48 volts.

     This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024.
     This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in Lathrop.
     I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.
     Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows.
     As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
     For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives.
     Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion.
     We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.
     Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey.
     We can open it up to questions, Martin.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go through investor questions.
     Question number one is from Michael.
>>> Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
     Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
     I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time.
     But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025.
     So sometime in the second half.
     That's just what our current schedule says.
     But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
     The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line.
     This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
     And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere.
     So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
     That will be a challenging production ramp.
     Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically.
     In fact, not practically.

     If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can start with questions in the queue.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
     Please go ahead.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
     Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you're seeing that play out?
     Obviously, it's a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are really in the way here, but we'd love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting the rollout of FSD throughout the balance of this year and into next year?

     And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car.
     It's pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, does the company anticipate a 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either of 2024 or 2025?
     If not, why not?
     Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before.
     We are between two major growth waves.
     The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.
     In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of the next generation vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is from Michael.
>>> When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
     Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.
     Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly.
     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
     And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
     Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.
-----
13. [Sentence #41, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got EPA rating of 315 miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
     This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
     And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
     For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such product should look.
     So it really just from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks the ass of any pickup truck, basically that's the goal.
     And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand has been incredible.
     I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we've never seen anything like it basically.
     I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
     So -- as many -- we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts.
     So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don't even have enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it, it's just great.
     So and then stepping back in 2018 from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than $1 billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production.
     So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of the Tesla team and I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.
     I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
>>> And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
     So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
     If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
     So where we will be in 10 years, very excited to consider the prospect.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much Elon and Zachary some opening remarks as well.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Thanks, Martin.
     This past year was truly transformational for Tesla and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of making this happen.
     On 2019 a few key points I'd like to highlight.
     On demand, while we've mentioned a few times, it's worth highlighting once again, over the course of the year we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.
     We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs even increasing slightly in Q4 and we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.
     With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno.
     As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost.
-----
14. [Sentence #2927, TSLA_Q4_2024] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     The line after that would be for 100,000 units a month.
     And I think probably with Version 2, it is a very rough guess because there's so much uncertainty here, very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that.
     But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one's receiving humanoid robots to these things like coming out like crazy.
     We can't build enough.
     We're always going to be in the -- we can't build enough situation.
     Demand will not be a problem even at a high price.
     And then I said like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- I'm confident at 1 million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000.
     If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car.
     So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over 1 million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that.
     What the price of Optimus is a different matter.
     The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thank you very much.
>>> The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi?
     And how will it impact revenue and scale?
     Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering

I can take that one.
     So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the weather.
     In Reno, you never know what's going to happen.
     But we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months.
     The first builds of the high volumes in design come late this year in 2025 and begin ramping early in 2026.
     But as we've said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer.
     I think it's really similar to Optimus.
     It's going to be set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it's much, much cheaper than any other transportation you could have.
     So, at that point, when we're at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla's revenue.
     Might be difficult to say how much.
     you want to add.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

No.

15. [Sentence #750, TSLA_Q4_2020] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
     So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development?
>>> What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
     Elon Musk

All right.
     So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
     So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
     We've got the designs fixed.
     We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
     We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
     So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.
     So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
     8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
     And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
     If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can start with questions in the queue.
-----
16. [Sentence #1278, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     I think, -- look at the big picture -- you initially always want to increase capacity at one factory because your logistics cost of transporting cars needs to be considered, especially as the cars become more affordable, you want to have factories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers.
     So, even if you could increase output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.
     So, in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas, I mean, coming up, we would want to deliver, say, Model Ys that are going to the eastern two-thirds of the United States from this factory.
     The logistics costs are going to be much less.
     But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and in -- at Giga Nevada and Shanghai.
     And as I said at the beginning of the call, this -- 2022 is the year we will be looking at factory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the end of this year.
     Yes.
     Martin Viecha

And the next question is, what are the biggest obstacles for Cybertruck volume production besides battery shortage?
     Elon Musk

Batteries will probably not be the limiting factor in Cybertruck production.
     There's a lot of new technology in the Cybertruck that will take some time to work through.
     And then, there's a question of like, what's the average cost of Cybertruck and to what degree is that affordable?
     There's -- you can make something infinitely desirable.
     But if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it because they don't have the money.
>>> I worry more about like how do we the Cybertruck affordable despite having awesome technology.
     That's the thing that will really set the rate.
     Aspirationally, we'd like it to go, in terms of just a rough order of magnitude, we'd like Cybertruck to be at least on the order of [indiscernible] vehicles a year.
     But it will take us a moment to get to that level.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one, economies of scale; number two, production design -- production line design efficiencies; number three, reduced transportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inflation; or number five, other sources?
     And how much further could margins improve and why?
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
     Basically -- yes, there's basically four major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvement in the Company.
     And they're in no particular order here but these are the big ones.
     So, our mix of Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.
     And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher profit than the Model 3.
     And so that is helpful on our margins.
     And then, as we increase the volume on that program with labor efficiencies, fixed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.
-----
17. [Sentence #1752, TSLA_Q4_2022] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.
     So it's giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
     They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
     But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
     And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
     And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive.
     But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
     So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.
     It's extremely expensive.
     And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
     So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?
>>> Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer.
     But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
     It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first.
     So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production.
     It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
     Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
     That's great Elon.
     Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops.
     We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
     Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     Martin Viecha

Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories?

18. [Sentence #1280, TSLA_Q4_2021] [SCALE ACHIEVED]

     And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it, but we've also -- that factory had a different line design, more efficient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volume there.

     And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla.
     So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question.
     Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp.
     What are the current roadblocks?
     And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
     Andrew Baglino

Yeah.
     Thanks, Martin.
     First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4.
     It was no small feat.
     Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
     As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install.
>>> Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
     Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.
     Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
     Is that still the current plan?
     Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
     Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.
     And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year.
     So it's an incredible product.
     I can't wait to drive it personally.
     It will be the car that I drive every day.
     I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
     And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.

     Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows.
     As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
     For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives.
     Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion.
     We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.
     Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey.
     We can open it up to questions, Martin.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go through investor questions.
     Question number one is from Michael.
     Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
     Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
     I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time.
>>> But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025.
     So sometime in the second half.
     That's just what our current schedule says.
     But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
     The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line.
     This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
     And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere.
     So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
     That will be a challenging production ramp.
     Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically.
     In fact, not practically.
     We will be.
     But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world.
     It's next level.

Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast.
     My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives.
     Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 pm Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
>>> So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023.
     We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
     And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year.
     This is really a phenomenal achievement.
     Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars.
     This is a record.
     In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
     And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area.
     It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps.
     And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
     What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
     Think about that.
     It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
     And it's enriched the community in so many different ways.

     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
     So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is, where are you in Cybertruck development?
     What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in 2021?
     Elon Musk

All right.
     So we finished almost all of the Cybertrack engineering.
     So we're no longer iterating at the design center level or design level.
     We've got the designs fixed.
>>> We're getting to – we'll soon order the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.
     We're actually going to be using even bigger Tesla machines for the rear body of Cybertruck because you've got – obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going to a lot of load.
     So we'll be using an 8,000 ton casting press for the rear body casting, as opposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y.
     So 6,000 tons was the biggest cast in the world.
     8,000 tons, quite a bit bigger than that.
     And I think it's going to be incredible vehicle.
     If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a few deliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     And now we can start with questions in the queue.
     Operator

Thank you.
     Our first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
     Please go ahead.
     Colin Rusch

Thanks so much, guys.
     Can you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you're seeing that play out?

23. [Sentence #31, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter.
     It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with zero advertising spend.
     I think that's like where we do say that from time-time and I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is I think quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without much of advertising.
     At our Fremont factory we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006 and obviously we expect to exceed that significantly this year.
     This rate of production was cheap before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont, so there's lot of potential to go beyond that number.
     For the Shanghai factory I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year.
     I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory.
     I think it's going to be incredible asset to the company and we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai, so lot of good progress there.
     Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.
     And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already.
     Now this is thanks to a great effort of our engineering team and we managed to achieve by far the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y four wheeler drive got EPA rating of 315 miles and this improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today.
     This is above what we previously stated by a pretty significant margin.
     And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just an incredible specs all around.
>>> For the Cybertruck, a few months ago we revealed obviously we revealed the Cybertruck, and that was -- that went viral and we tried to build a product that -a product that is superior in every way without any preconceptions of how such product should look.
     So it really just from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks the ass of any pickup truck, basically that's the goal.
     And we wanted it to look like something that just came out of the sci-fi movie set from the future and the demand has been incredible.
     I have never seen actually such a level of demand at this this -- we've never seen anything like it basically.
     I think we will make as about as many as we can sell for many years.
     So -- as many -- we'll sell as many as we can make, it's going to be pretty nuts.
     So, and I think actually the product is better than people realize even, they don't even have enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it, it's just great.
     So and then stepping back in 2018 from a financial standpoint, we were free cash flow was breakeven, but in 2019 we managed to generate more than $1 billion free cash flow, while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production.
     So, I think to -- for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity, while developing new products, while improving the core engineering is a testament to the -- I think incredible performance of the Tesla team and I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.
     I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control and is what has allowed us to get to this compelling financial numbers, while at the same time growing the company at an incredible pace.
     And in conclusion when I think of what we have in front of us, the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck some very exciting improvements in battery technology for the full self-driving, we got the next-gen Roadster and probably in a bunch of other products we'll [indiscernible] too.
     It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product and technology roadmap.
     So super-fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years.
     If you look back 10 years from today to 2010, we will produce approximately a 1,000 times more cars in 2020 then we produced in 2010, 8,000 and we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit, Powerwall and Powerpack other things too.
-----
24. [Sentence #735, TSLA_Q4_2020] [PLAN]
     And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company's long-term earnings power is tied to profit per unit of battery capacity?
     Three-terawatt hours target from Battery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what you assume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     It is.
     So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability of cells.
     What's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours?
     And you can't grow faster than that.
     Now at Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of cars dramatically, such that you can actually get a pretty good range even with the standard range battery pack.
     It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the high 200s.
     And some slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with standard pack and an order 500 kilometers.
     So there's efficiency improvements in the car.
     But fundamentally, the growth is dependent on cell production.
     And there's, obviously, a lot of other companies that want to -- that have a need for sales.
>>> So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
     It is not to make less use of our cell suppliers.
     In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increase purchases from cell suppliers.
     And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it be CATL or Panasonic or LG that we will take as many batteries as they can produce.
     So -- and we urge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.
     Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable.
     But I'm just trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not to disintermediate our suppliers.
     It is to supplement our suppliers.
     And we went to our suppliers of cells to increase their production, and in addition have our production that is simply taking up the amount beyond, which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.
     So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us.
     And so we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the – and then – I mean probably the Roadster value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output, and then at least double that for autonomy revenue probably one level.
     And that's how you figure out the value of the company, I think, long term.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
     The next question is about 4680 cells which we already covered in the retail section of this call.
-----
25. [Sentence #1626, TSLA_Q4_2022] [PLAN]
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
     Let's now go to investor questions.
     The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter.
     This has raised demand concerns.
     Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
     I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
     Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
     Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The second question is in a similar vein.
     What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels?
     We've answered that one as well.
     So let's go to the next one.
>>> The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs?
     So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
     Elon Musk

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
     Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
     You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.
     So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
     And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits.
     So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
     Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
     So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit.
     The regulations here are still influx and there continues to be updates so this is just our best understanding at the moment.
     But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.
     And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways.
     And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
-----
26. [Sentence #270, TSLA_Q4_2019] [PLAN]
     And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10-K, but back to the growth rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan facility in place to support that growth.
     So that helps.
     And then as our production volumes increase that generates more cash on the business as well, that allows us to continue to fund additional factory.
     So I wouldn't necessarily view it as limited as you described it.
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think on our [indiscernible] a few years ago, I said in my estimate first is that Tesla would grow at an average compound average rate of in excess of 50%, I -- by saw hold to that belief.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go to the next question.
     Operator

Our next question comes from [indiscernible].
     Unidentified Analyst

Good afternoon and congratulations on the progress.
     First question related to Cybertruck, you mentioned you will sell as many as you can make.
     Can you remind me how many you think you can make and any thoughts on the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?
     Elon Musk

Yes, I think we don't comment on those detailed numbers except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, three or four years, something like that.
     So the thing we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one product to another and you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles.
>>> So that's part of the reason why we have not for example really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells and unless we've got a lot of battery cells available then -- and say like accelerating production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making pure Model 3 or Model Y cars.
     So we've got a really -- make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt of the batteries.
     This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.
     So that we said we're going to do kind of like a Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this what our plans are.
     I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter, because I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter.
     So tentatively sort of in the April timeframe, we will do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't know a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.
     Unidentified Analyst

Great.
     I'll look forward to that Battery Day.
     Elon, you also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up and the only vehicle not announced for Master Plan Part II is a high passenger density vehicle, any light that you can give us regarding that project?
     Elon Musk

Yes, going back to what I just said that we got to improve the total battery capacity otherwise we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road.
     So what we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that we already that are riding on our fleet.
     And it's just generally true when I see some I think sort of sensible comments by our arc invest, whether pointing out that really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves and like the average, yes I mean the average number of occupants in a car, I think is like 1.2 and maybe with autonomy maybe it will go to 1.4 maybe, but I'm not sure if that -- it even goes there.
     So, well, it makes sense just for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of truck like that or something like probably, but like I said we're going to solve those battery -- we got to scale battery production to crazy levels that people cannot even balance today, that's the real problem.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
-----
27. [Sentence #1444, TSLA_Q4_2021] [PLAN]
     But there will be a challenge with traffic.
     So, we like this little tiny baby company, The Boring Company, which I initially started as a joke, and now I think it actually could be quite essential to alleviating the insane traffic that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce the pain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number of cars on the road.
     I mean, it's going to be -- I think it's way cheaper to draw a price point with robotaxi, which is an autonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past three or four years will be capable of that, than a bus or a subway, will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket.
     So, if we want to get -- I'm not going to take the bus.
     If it costs you -- I don't know for arguments sake $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, taking the bus, especially in cold weather or dark or maybe a little bit dangerous or that.
     I just do not understand how profound change this is.
     It's not like some little feature, select the most profound software upgrade, maybe in history.
     Millions of cars suddenly have about 4 or 5 times utility [indiscernible] overnight.
     I don't actually know how to quantify that financially except that it's some big number.
     Toni Sacconaghi

Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask.
     You talked about your product road map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better.
     That would put you at 3.2 million vehicles or more in 2024.
     And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being 250,000 vehicles.
>>> If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think that you can sell more than 3 million vehicles with two very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024, or how do we think about that or what else is missing in that equation?
     Elon Musk

Yes.
     I mean, it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated.
     If an asset has 5 times more utilization than the -- it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.
     So, if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden, but maybe better than that because still you don't want to drive.
     So the person can be engaged in productivity or amusement instead of having to onerously drive through traffic.
     So, it's probably better than 5 times, I don't know.
     Yes.
     I mean, basically, if the cost of our cars do not change at all, we would still sell as many as we could possibly make.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
     Pierre Ferragu

I wanted to come back on battery.
     So, it's great to hear on one hand that you guys expect to sell like the first car with 4680 this quarter and at the same time that you don't really depend on that ramp to achieve your -- what you hope to achieve in terms of significant volume growth this year.
     And the question I had is I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's fourth quarter 2024 q&a webcast.
     My name is Travis Axelrod, the here at Tesla.
     And I'm joined today by Elon Musk and Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives.
     Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.

Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Thank you.
     So, in summary, in Q4, we set record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year.
>>> So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries.
     Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024.
     Where to invest $1,000 right now
When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
     After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,040% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.
     They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…

*Stock Advisor returns as of July 21, 2025

That's worth noting.
     Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth, No.
     1 was Model Y.
     We are staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down -- I don't know what -- really, I was going to say doubling down in autonomy, but really, it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing frankly.
     Doubling is not even enough.
     We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing, AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense.
     Like it's, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.
     And I've said this before and I'll stand by it.
     I see a path.
     I'm not saying it's an easy path but I see a path of Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far.
-----
29. [Sentence #2169, TSLA_Q4_2023] [PLAN]
     This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
     And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere.
     So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
     That will be a challenging production ramp.
     Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically.
     In fact, not practically.
     We will be.
     But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world.
     It's next level.
     So it's always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like.
     So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially.
     So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don't know.
     It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year.
>>> We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is from Michael again.
     What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to get there?
     Elon Musk

Karn?
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I've seen some people commenting about that.
     To date, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory.
     And the goal is to keep it that way, not only for Cyber, but for our future vehicle programs.
     And as Elon said, it is an S-curve here too.
     It's hard to predict these things, but I'm just describing our goals.
     Elon Musk

It's a hard problem.
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     Elon Musk

There are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2021 Q&A Webcast.
     My name is Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives.

     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thanks, Martin.
>>> So, just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehicles in general.
     And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year, we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year.
     This level of growth didn't happen by coincidence.
     It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout the company.
     Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reported quarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin.
     Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in 2021, our accumulated profitability since the inception of the Company became positive, which I think makes us a real company at this point.
     This is a critical milestone for the Company.
     So, after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin.
     So, we've begun production at both Texas and Berlin, we started that last quarter.
     But that's not the most important thing.
     We focus more on when we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars to customers.
     But I think it is worth noting that we -- and as the internet has observed, we've been making quite a few cars in Texas and Berlin, so -- in Austin and Berlin.
     So, in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.
     Capacity expansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories and new locations in the future.
