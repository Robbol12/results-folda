start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">52</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[PILOT]</span>
    So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net 
training.
    It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training.
    So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is 
just enormous.
    So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear.
    But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.
    And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a <span class="r2">100</span> exaflops by the end of next year.
    So, to date, over <span class="r2">300</span> million miles have been driven using FSD beta.
    That <span class="r2">300</span> million mile number is going to seem small very quickly.
    It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles.
    And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human.
    We see a clear path to full self-driving being <span class="r2">10</span> times safer than the average human driver, so.
    And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, <span class="r2">4</span>, but 
it’s really dedicated.
    It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting 
edge of AI development.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production</span>
<span class="r5">line in Austin.</span>
    I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory.
    This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 
<span class="r2">20</span>-foot garage.
    So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside.
    So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it 
looks on the outside.
    And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last 
millimeter.
    So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really 
maximize the utility of the volume.
    And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year.
    Some other highlights.
    Our global Supercharging network now stands at over <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> -- roughly <span class="r2">50</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> connectors and over <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> locations.
    As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the
North American Charging Standard.
    We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access
to our charging network.
    We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right 
thing in general.
    So, that’s the goal there.

    Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    And let’s go to investor questions.
    The first question on licensing FSD we’ve already answered.
    So, let’s go to the second one.
    The second question is, what is the status of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?
    How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day?
    When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update.
    So, in Texas, <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production increased <span class="r2">80</span>% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed <span class="r2">10</span> million production cells 
produced here in Texas.
    So, congrats to the team for that.
    Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a <span class="r2">25</span>% reduction in 
cell COGS.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5">% higher energy density than current </span>
<span class="r5">production.</span>
    That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization.
    As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on
cost per cell.
    Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like 
electrochemistry basis.
    We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring 
significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.
    Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered <span class="r2">4680</span> 
production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost
reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on 
the revenue model?
    Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software 
margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
    Unidentified Company Representative

We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.
    Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target 
margins.
    The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of 
our full factory ramp in <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, 
the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour 
today, actually.

    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add to what Elon mentioned.
    So, the numbers that he mentioned are between R&amp;D spend and capital spend.
    And this is moving quickly.
    And so, we provide a three-year outlook on our capital expense.
    We are considering these expenses in that outlook.
    And as that moves up and down, we’ll continue to update our guidance in the Q.

Elon Musk

Yes.
    I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training.
    That’s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster.
    So that’s it.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

And it’s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.
    Dan Levy

Great.
    Thank you.
    Just as a follow-up, I recognize there’s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you’re sticking with your near 
term, your volume target of <span class="r2">50</span>% CAGR.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution.</span>
    There’s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth.
    But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that <span class="r2">50</span>% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking 
differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
    Elon Musk

It’s not about getting more share.
    It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually 
something that in the future may be worth as much as <span class="r2">5</span> times what it is today.
    Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe <span class="r2">10</span> hours of driving a week.
    If sort of -- if this says <span class="r2">1.5</span> hours a day on average, that’s <span class="r2">10</span> hours a week-ish.
    If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or
partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others.
    Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house.
    The value is just tremendous.
    So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making 
more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase.
    I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by 
regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let’s go to the next analyst.

    The next question on FSD.
    Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla 
instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    This is a question we get asked a lot.
    So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD.
    This is a onetime amnesty.
    So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within 
reasonable delivery time frames.
    So yes, I hope this makes people happy.
    This is a onetime thing.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, 
pricing and specifications?
    Elon Musk

Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.
    So, that’s really not an issue.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot.</span>
    It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle.
    So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain 
and internal production.
    So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth.
    We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps.
    But first order approximation, there’s like <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck.
    And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    So, it’s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, 
and we will be delivering the car this year.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is critics of Gigacasting contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, 
essentially pushing costs on to the customer.
    Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?
    Elon Musk

That must be why everyone’s copying us.
    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Elon.

    On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK 
and California with over <span class="r2">6</span> gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year.
    In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2.
    Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor 
to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring.
    It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of <span class="r2">20</span> years of 
recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.

    In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials.
    Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to
come.
    Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful 
contributor to overall profitability this quarter.
    And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during 
uncertain times.
    Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you’re making.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Thanks Martin.
    As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our 
energy and services and other businesses.
    Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.
    As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence 
and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.
    First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies 
that will drive the long-term value of the business.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as</span>
<span class="r5">new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our </span>
<span class="r5">R&amp;D spend.</span>
    This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our
Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital 
expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.
    Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but 
most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments.
    This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital 
improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.
    If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy,
despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.
    We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and 
commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin 
and Berlin factories.
    For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, 
particularly with Megapack.
    As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific
revenue recognition milestones.
    As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned 
downtimes for factory upgrades.
    These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost.
    However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.
    It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution 
positively or negatively in the near term.
    Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.
    Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.
