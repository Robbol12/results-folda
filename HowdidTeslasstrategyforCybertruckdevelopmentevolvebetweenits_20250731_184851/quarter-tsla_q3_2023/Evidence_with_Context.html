start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">21</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r2">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span class="r5">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span class="r2">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
    It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to <span class="r2">18</span> months before it is a significant 
positive cash flow contributor.
    I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
    The demand is off the charts.
    We have over <span class="r2">1</span> million people who’ve reserved the car.

<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">91</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    That’s my best guess.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, particularly progress towards 
performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?
    Thank you.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Sure thing, Martin.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production in Texas increased <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span class="r2">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span class="r2">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck cell with </span><span class="r5">10</span><span class="r5">% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.</span>
    This quarter we convert to building a <span class="r2">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span class="r2">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span class="r2">2</span> of the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span class="r2">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
    A – Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from institutional investors.
    Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the
opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
    A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser 
focus on efficiency improvement.
    As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production 
volume.
    For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of 
the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.
    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.

    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span class="r2">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span class="r2">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
    Now, I can say that -- if you say, well, where will things end up?
    I think we’ll end up with roughly a <span class="r2">0.25</span> million Cybertrucks a year, I don’t think we’re going to reach that output 
rate next year.
    I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    That’s my best guess.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, particularly progress towards

    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
    And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
    Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
    Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy 
business.
    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span class="r2">37</span>,<span class="r2">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot </span>
<span class="r5">production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.</span>
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
    However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
    This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately <span class="r8">[</span>$<span class="r2">8.9</span> billion<span class="r8">]</span> <span class="r8">(</span>ph<span class="r8">)</span> and free cash flows of
approximately $<span class="r2">2.3</span> billion.
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.

    And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there’s too many stickers internally in the car that nobody 
ever sees.
    There’s something as simple as a QR code.
    You may think, well, putting a QR code on a part.
    Why don’t just put them on there, it’s like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code?
    Unidentified Company Representative

That’s a penny.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the 
line.
    Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
    Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
    That would also bring some savings from higher production.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.</span>
    So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
    And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like
any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I
call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over <span class="r2">15</span> pounds 
right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
    You’re still fat.
    So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
    That’s the actual way.
    It’s not super fun because food is delicious.
    And personally, I’m not -- I don’t love working out.
    I wish I did, but I don’t.
    Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.
    Martin Viecha

All right.

    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span class="r2">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.

Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took.
    You’ve taken now about $<span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> out of the average vehicle costs over the past year.
    Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the 
factory changes you alluded to?
    Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here?
    And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next-gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked 
about earlier this year?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
    There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
    We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
    So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
    Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
    We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
    So, they will impact in the near term.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we </span>
<span class="r5">will be dealing with.</span>
    On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to 
predict precisely as to where we land.
    But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a 
daily basis.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional 
cost downs for <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
    And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.
    Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
    Elon Musk

Not at this time.
    Rod Lache

Okay.
    And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a 
vacuum.
    And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting 
the law of large numbers on some of your products.
    Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment?
    And any thoughts along those lines?
    Elon Musk

I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">9</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">122</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they 
simply cannot afford it.
    And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in 
revenue, but in unit volume.
    If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than
our car.
    So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
    I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
    I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r2">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r5">2.3</span><span class="r5"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5">, representing </span><span class="r5">28</span><span class="r5">% growth </span>
<span class="r5">versus </span><span class="r5">2023</span><span class="r5"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r2">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r2">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
    I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.

Thank you.
    Next question is do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the robotaxi driven or non-driven?
    What excites you most about how this project is progressing?
    Elon Musk

Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven.
    I guess, I’m very excited about our progress with autonomy, the end-to-end, nothing but nets self-driving software 
is amazing.
