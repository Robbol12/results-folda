    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.
    Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.
    Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me, guys?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Amazing.
    I&#x27;m very impressed that you managed to figure that out.
    Martin Viecha

We have to.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you, Pierre.

<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">71</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on 
track to be complete this quarter.
    Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
    However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
    Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
    And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the 
pack timeline I just mentioned.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> model 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span class="r2">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.
    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span class="r2">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> 
million units with just S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, truck and the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> car?&quot;

    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r5">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>
<span class="r5">the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by </span><span class="r5">2024</span><span class="r5">?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span class="r2">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible there.
    Over the last <span class="r2">12</span> months, we&#x27;ve done about <span class="r2">430</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars of production.
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">4</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">235</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r4">[UNCERTAIN]</span>
    The next set of upcoming question is, Can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, 
something less than <span class="r2">10</span>-K?
    Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.
    You lose the value on the trade-in, and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
    If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD 
compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.

    Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I&#x27;m excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and
into <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing 
to improve our precision and pace of execution.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
    The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on
