    <pre style="font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"><code style="font-family:inherit"><span class="r1">[TSLA_Q2_2020]</span> How did Tesla&#x27;s strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its <span class="r2">2019</span> unveiling and its production 
start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">32</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter, and although the automotive 
industry was down about <span class="r2">30</span>% year-over-year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first 
half of the year.
    So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up.
    We&#x27;re also very excited to announce that we&#x27;re going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.
    It&#x27;s going to be right near Austin.
    It will be about -- I&#x27;ll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be a lot of questions.
    But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and <span class="r2">15</span> minutes from Downtown Austin, and it&#x27;s 
about <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> acres, and we&#x27;re going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning.
    It&#x27;s right on the Colorado River.
    So we&#x27;re actually going to have a boardwalk where there&#x27;ll a hiking and biking trail.
    It&#x27;s going to basically be an ecological paradise.
    Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well.
    So not closed and only Tesla.
    So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please 
let us know.
    This is -- we&#x27;re going to be doing a major factory there.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s also where we&#x27;ll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi.</span>
    And we&#x27;ll be doing Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the eastern half of North America.
    Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California.
    But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and <span class="r2">3</span> and Y for the western half of North 
America.
    And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California.
    So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California.
    And just to emphasize, we&#x27;ll continue to grow in California, but we&#x27;ll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck 
and Semi programs in Texas.
    And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic 
development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed.
    The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of 
Tesla down the road.
    Let&#x27;s see, is there anything more I want to say about?
    There&#x27;s a lot of information.
    So anything, guys?
    All right.
    Well, I&#x27;m sure they have lots of questions.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as 
well as movements in working capital.
    A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
    While our AR balance is usually about <span class="r2">20</span>% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors.
    First, overall, less than <span class="r2">30</span>% of our receivables is associated with new car sales.
    Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain 
methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted 
significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter.
    Third, roughly <span class="r2">40</span>% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV 
incentive programs, both of which have been increasing.
    Customer deposits reduced slightly as well.
    Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to 
reduce driving down this balance.
    As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.
    We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital 
management.
    This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of 
three new factories over the next <span class="r2">1.5</span> years.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to questions from institutional investors first.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling </span><span class="r4">20</span><span class="r4"> million units </span>
<span class="r4">per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years </span>
<span class="r4">beyond Model </span><span class="r4">3</span><span class="r4">, Y and the Cybertruck?</span>
    Cheaper, smaller versions of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y?
    Or region-specific vehicles?
    Or anything else?
    Elon Musk

I don&#x27;t think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what&#x27;s announced because I think we want to reserve 
that for product launches.
    But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher 
capacity  vehicle of some kind.
    These are likely things at some point.
    But I do think there&#x27;s a long way to go with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi.
    So it&#x27;s a long way to go with those.
    I think we&#x27;ll do the obvious things.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla?
    What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
    Elon Musk

Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">321</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;ve…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, you can&#x27;t plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world.
    You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price.
    That&#x27;s the real limit.
    So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling 
constraint.
    And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor.
    So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog 
formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate.
    And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others.
    And there&#x27;s a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the second question is, now that it&#x27;s time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more </span>
<span class="r4">detail on production plans?</span>
    What weekly production rate is considered volume production?
    And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    So we&#x27;ll start production next year, as we announced it before.
    I&#x27;m personally very excited about the project.
    I can&#x27;t wait.
    We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars.
    But we&#x27;re going to accelerate that.
    I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla to carry our own freight, probably mostly 
between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route.
    We&#x27;re going to prove that we have very good reliability.
    And so far, the early units do have it, but we&#x27;ll do that at a larger scale.
    And we have also promised some early units to some long term, very patient and supportive customers, and we&#x27;ll do 
that.
    Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    It&#x27;s like a UPS, uninterruptible power supply of a normal size.
    But just ensure that this grid has smooth sailing.
    And then the batteries, the computers like all interact with each other and make sure that they&#x27;re working together 
to make the grid smooth.
    And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working together and interacting 
with third-party systems as well.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    Essentially, are distributed.
    It does both.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    I mean, we&#x27;ve…

Elon Musk

It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
    Drew Baglino

    It&#x27;s actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems.
    And I think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad rep, especially in the U.S. for a long time.
    And I think people didn&#x27;t think that manufactured -- they sort of put manufacturing is like, oh, this is for some 
boring, just making copies, whatever.
    But actually, there&#x27;s far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the products itself, order 
magnitude.
    So like if there&#x27;s one thing that comes out of this call, it&#x27;s like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, new
manufacturing techniques and have input into the product itself, it&#x27;s not like you just get touch the product and say, 
hey, make this product and it&#x27;s kind of a lousy design.
    If you&#x27;re manufacturing, you get to change the product design, and say, hey, this product, you&#x27;re asking your 
manufacturers dumb.
    Like, great, let&#x27;s fix it.
    So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don&#x27;t just get force fed a sandwich.
    You get to change the product design.
    So it&#x27;s super exciting.
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

And there&#x27;s nothing more rewarding than going from <span class="r2">0</span> cars an hour to <span class="r2">5</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a week or <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars a day.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.</span>
    Martin Viecha

And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
    Elon Musk

Well, right now, <span class="r2">0</span>.
    But long term, a lot.
    Drew Baglino

It&#x27;s our biggest property.
    Elon Musk

Yes, it&#x27;s biggest property, true.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com.
    The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate 
exceeding automotive.
    Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook?
    How disruptive is Tesla&#x27;s Autobidder technology?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I can&#x27;t emphasize.
    I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">6</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">265</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And we evolve the lines even after they&#x27;re both this rapid evolution of the production system.
    So…

Drew Baglino

    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I can&#x27;t emphasize.
    I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive.
    So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business.
    So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector?
    Bigger than automotive.
    And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is
going to be primarily solar and followed by wind.
    And those are intermittent.
    So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the solar energy, because the wind doesn&#x27;t always blow and the sun 
doesn&#x27;t always shine.
    So there&#x27;s like three elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energy generation; 
battery storage; and electric transport, those three things.
    And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy.
    So I can&#x27;t emphasize enough.
    Yes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">122</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity.
    And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume.
    Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2.
    This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting 
of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&amp;A within operating expenses.
    On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $<span class="r2">8.6</span> billion, which included free cash flows 
of over $<span class="r2">400</span> million.
    This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as 
well as movements in working capital.
    A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables.
