    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter.
    What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts?
    And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”

Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, I can take that.
    I think two points on this question.
    The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company.
    Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long 
term of the Company.
    Elon Musk

But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No.
    And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well.
    Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well.
    So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck?</span>
    What is the initial Phase <span class="r2">1</span> production target?
    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply 
chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Of course.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1779</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r7">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r2">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
    The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and</span>
<span class="r4">then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.</span>
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span class="r2">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.
    It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to <span class="r2">18</span> months before it is a significant 
positive cash flow contributor.
    I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess.
    The demand is off the charts.
    We have over <span class="r2">1</span> million people who’ve reserved the car.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">162</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r8">[PILOT]</span>
    In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $<span class="r2">1.49</span> a watt after tax incentives, which is
the lowest in the industry.
    We&#x27;re able to do this by leveraging our online vehicle ordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft
costs associated with sales and marketing.
    As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiency increase, leading to increased 
profitability in the retrofit business.
    We&#x27;re using the same methodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the 
technology backbone of the company.
    Solar Roof is especially exciting as we&#x27;ve gained significant experience over the last year in the installation 
process, which is a key enabler to scale the business.
    We&#x27;ve recently demonstrated our ability to complete Solar Roof installation in just one day.
    We&#x27;re pleased now, this still requires one to two days to remove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof
installation.
    Clearly, there will be a range of installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors.
    Overall, our reduced installation time provides a better customer experience, and will enable the business to grow 
exponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.
    In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus on increasing scale 
while reducing cost to maximize profitability.
    I want to thank the team again for their hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, everyone.
    And let&#x27;s begin with questions from say.com.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The first question from retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> cell production at Giga Berlin at </span>
<span class="r4">the same time as vehicle production?</span>
    Can Tesla share more information on what products you&#x27;ll use the battery cells from the pilot line in Fremont?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    Drew, do you want to take that?
    Drew Baglino

Sure.
    Yes, we will incorporate <span class="r2">4680</span> design solutions into many applications in time across both energy and vehicle.
    And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the new factory in Berlin as it ramps.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question, which is question number two from retail shareholders.
    Does Tesla&#x27;s tablet cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates?
    Does it improve the required taper curve?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium plating on the anode.
    And while the tablet&#x27;s architecture helps avoid overheating because it&#x27;s a more power dense architecture at high 
continuous charge rates, it doesn&#x27;t change the anode plating story.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we&#x27;re pulling that.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    Most the time, you don&#x27;t need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
    The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of 
the auto industry.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it&#x27;s underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
    And that&#x27;s why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people 
don&#x27;t realize that it has so much capability.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
    What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in </span>
<span class="r4">the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of </span><span class="r4">2026</span><span class="r4"> and ramping really throughout the year </span>
<span class="r4">to full production.</span>
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it&#x27;s really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
    We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

In that world where it&#x27;s about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it&#x27;s a no brainer.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
    Fundamentally, if you&#x27;ve got a Semi, the fully considered cost per mile per ton of transport is better than a diesel
truck.
    Any company that doesn&#x27;t adopt an electric Semi will lose.
    It&#x27;s not a subjective thing.
    It&#x27;s like whether do you like just competitive -- we want the stat -- we want to have a good old Semi truck.
    But frankly, if we made a good old Semi truck, would it matter?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

And this is proving so in our fleets, in Pepsi&#x27;s Partner.

    I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    That’s my best guess.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, particularly progress towards 
performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?
    Thank you.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Sure thing, Martin.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production in Texas increased <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span class="r2">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span class="r2">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck cell with </span><span class="r4">10</span><span class="r4">% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.</span>
    This quarter we convert to building a <span class="r2">100</span>% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four 
lines in Phase <span class="r2">1</span> over the next three quarters.
    Phase <span class="r2">2</span> of the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span class="r2">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
    A – Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from institutional investors.
    Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the
opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
    A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser 
focus on efficiency improvement.
    As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production 
volume.
    For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of 
the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.
    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    The next question is, Elon said that we get an update on Cybertruck in November a year ago, but it hasn&#x27;t happened 
and we know there are a lot of updates.
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.</span>
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.
    Question-And-Answer Session

Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Thank you very much.
    We just promoted Pierre to a presenter here.
    Pierre Ferragu

Can you hear me, guys?
    Martin Viecha

Yes, we can hear you.
    Pierre Ferragu

Amazing.
    I&#x27;m very impressed that you managed to figure that out.
    Martin Viecha

We have to.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you, Pierre.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">7</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">717</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2021]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on 
track to be complete this quarter.
    Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
    However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
    Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
    And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the 
pack timeline I just mentioned.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> model 
in <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span class="r2">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.</span>
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.
    If for instance, say the training, and that takes one day instead of one week, makes a huge difference in our 
ability to push out more updates.
    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span class="r2">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> 
million units with just S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, truck and the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> car?&quot;
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">8</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1826</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span class="r2">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And now let’s go to investor questions.
    The first investor question comes from Craig.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4">?</span>
    Elon Musk

It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point.
    Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult.
    And like I said, there’s no way around that.
    If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally <span class="r2">200</span> models that
are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not
that hard.
    But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is 
extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy.
    You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car.
    So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.
    Now, I can say that -- if you say, well, where will things end up?
    I think we’ll end up with roughly a <span class="r2">0.25</span> million Cybertrucks a year, I don’t think we’re going to reach that output 
rate next year.
    I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in <span class="r2">2025</span>.
    That’s my best guess.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, particularly progress towards 
performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?

    I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better.
    And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times.
    Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Elon.
    And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
    Vaibhav Taneja

Thanks, Martin.
    Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy 
business.
    Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period 
of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment.
    As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory 
upgrades.
    This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases.
    Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $<span class="r2">37</span>,<span class="r2">500</span>.
    We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight.
    Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; On the operating expenses front, R&amp;D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot </span>
<span class="r4">production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo.</span>
    We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&amp;D will 
continue to grow in the near term.
    However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.
    This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately <span class="r10">[</span>$<span class="r2">8.9</span> billion<span class="r10">]</span> <span class="r10">(</span>ph<span class="r10">)</span> and free cash flows of
approximately $<span class="r2">2.3</span> billion.
    Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, 
primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments.
    Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from
our growing fleet.
    As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying
happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer.
    And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our
vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.
    We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs.
    However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins.
    To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard 
Model Y for as low as $<span class="r2">399</span> a month.
    In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, 
maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next 
generation platform.
    We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term.
    Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.

    The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more
than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.
    Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be.
    But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle 
production, sales deliveries by -- on average <span class="r2">50</span>% a year as far into the future as we can see.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by <span class="r2">50</span>% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out
the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so.
    In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there 
weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big.
    So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there 
aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, do you still expect <span class="r2">50</span>% annualized growth for the foreseeable future?
    Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market?
    Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand 
remained stable, or is it even rising?
    There are three questions there.
    Elon Musk

Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at</span>
<span class="r4">a </span><span class="r4">50</span><span class="r4">% or greater compound annual growth rate.</span>
    It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot 
more.
    In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and 
especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    We could, but who wants?
    Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Committed to continuing<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

Yes, we obviously are -- yes.
    But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth.
    Yes.
    At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement.
    So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the 
cars.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

There’s always the latest Tesla.

    But realistically, there&#x27;s a whole lot more that comes into play when iterating software updates.
    The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing and validation, needs to be set up for faster 
iteration.
    So daily updates are not really realistic for now.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The next question is, &quot;Can you provide an update on future model development and how much diversity in your fleet 
will be necessary to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> million in annual volumes?
    The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over <span class="r2">1</span> million units, so is it possible to achieve <span class="r2">20</span> 
million units with just S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, truck and the $<span class="r2">25</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> car?&quot;
    Lars Moravy

Thanks, Martin.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, we&#x27;ve seen record growth of both Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y segments, where Model <span class="r2">3</span> is currently
the bestselling luxury sedan worldwide.
    As we mentioned at our shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Model Y is poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world.
    Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product.
    As we&#x27;ve said publicly, we&#x27;ll eventually expand the vehicle line up to get to larger volumes, and we believe that we
will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size, large sedans, SUVs, and trucks to do so.
    Along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question, a question from retail shareholder is, what is Tesla &#x27;s goal for vehicle production capacity for </span>
<span class="r4">the four current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin by </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4">?</span>
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of <span class="r2">50</span>% per year.
    And so, you can extrapolate that out.
    There may be some periods of time in which we&#x27;re well ahead of that.
    There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we&#x27;re slightly lower than that.
    But that remains the long-term goal of the Company.
    In Fremont, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible there.
    Over the last <span class="r2">12</span> months, we&#x27;ve done about <span class="r2">430</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars of production.
    And based upon everything that we know in the factory where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we’re 
targeting to increase that another <span class="r2">50</span>%.
    I think that will be a difficult goal, but that&#x27;s the goal that the internal team has.
    And they&#x27;re going to continue to push on that.
    As we look towards Shanghai, we&#x27;re continuing to push the boundaries there, and we continue to ramp production there
as well.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">12</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1710</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2022]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So it’s not like factory to factory.
    It’s a multiplication of both, simplicity and scale.
    So yes, we’re excited about where it’s headed.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $<span class="r2">70</span> a kilowatt hour cell 
-- $<span class="r2">70</span> per kilowatt hour cell, before any incentive.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Before incentive.
    Elon Musk

Before incentive.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
    Toni Sacconaghi

I just wanted to follow up on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cells and where we are seeing them deployed today.
    So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st?
    Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin?
    And is -- do you anticipate <span class="r2">4680</span> being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And how do you balance the need for </span><span class="r4">4680</span><span class="r4"> across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4">?</span>
    And I have a follow-up, please.
    Elon Musk

Okay.
    The Semi doesn’t use 4680s.
    Yes.
    We are making Model Ys.
    Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are <span class="r2">4680</span>.
    And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is <span class="r2">4680</span> Model Y?
    Unidentified Company Representative

Yes.
    <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> miles.
    Elon Musk

<span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> miles.
    Pretty good.
    Unidentified Company Representative

No problems yet.

    And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there’s too many stickers internally in the car that nobody 
ever sees.
    There’s something as simple as a QR code.
    You may think, well, putting a QR code on a part.
    Why don’t just put them on there, it’s like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code?
    Unidentified Company Representative

That’s a penny.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the 
line.
    Unidentified Company Representative

More than a penny.
    Elon Musk

Yes, absolutely.
    So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Very much escaping prison.
    Vaibhav Taneja

On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up.
    That would also bring some savings from higher production.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about.</span>
    So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately.
    And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like
any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I
call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over <span class="r2">15</span> pounds 
right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm.
    You’re still fat.
    So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out.
    That’s the actual way.
    It’s not super fun because food is delicious.
    And personally, I’m not -- I don’t love working out.
    I wish I did, but I don’t.
    Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.

    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply 
chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
    So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.
    I’ll be there in person.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.</span>
    That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, <span class="r2">500</span>-mile range.
    Just to be clear, <span class="r2">500</span> miles with the cargo.
    Yes, <span class="r2">500</span> miles with the cargo on level ground.
    Yes, sure.
    Not up.
    It’s excellent.
    But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
    And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.
    And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look 
at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
    I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally.
    It’s not a number.

    We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into 
production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.
    We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version <span class="r2">12</span>.
    This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out.
    Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing 
reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work.
    The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes.
    And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle.
    So, interesting to think about that.
    We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer.
    And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
in the world by far.
    If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not 
clear what the limit is.
    Regarding energy storage, we deployed <span class="r2">4</span> gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3.
    And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business.
    Energy and service now contribute over $<span class="r2">0.5</span> billion to quarterly profit.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck.</span>
    I am too.
    I’ve driven the car.
    It’s an amazing product.
    I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and
then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive.
    This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new 
vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems 
proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale.
    So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best
product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price 
that people can afford.
    Often people do not understand what is truly hard.
    That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard.
    People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car.
    And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to
design a prototype.
    But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like <span class="r2">10</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>% harder to get to volume 
production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash 
flow.
    That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a <span class="r2">100</span> years apart from Tesla.
    So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

    The next set of upcoming question is, Can Tesla allow for FSD to be transferred to another vehicle at a fee, 
something less than <span class="r2">10</span>-K?
    Early adopters are paying the price if they want to upgrade their vehicle.
    You lose the value on the trade-in, and now you have to buy in at a higher cost.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

I don&#x27;t think that this is widely known but we already actually doing the sentiment of what this question is asking.
    If you trade in your Tesla to Tesla, we -- there&#x27;s a difference in price that we pay for a trade-in that has FSD 
compared to one that doesn&#x27;t.
    And so, there&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s that premium that we pay to repurchase the FSD.
    That money can then be applied towards the purchase of the new car.
    So, I just -- we hear this feedback quite a bit, we see it on social media, we see it in the forums, etc.
    And so, this already does exist.
    And not directly in the form here.
    And we don&#x27;t call it out explicitly in the trade-in, potentially that we have increased the price of your trade-in 
as a result.
    And hopefully, this clears this out because we do actually do that.

<span class="r4">and we know there are a lot of updates.</span>
    Will you show off the new and improved Cybertruck?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah.
    Thanks, Martin.
    We get a lot of questions on Cybertruck.
    We&#x27;ve been busy detailing the Cybertruck to achieve the prototype version we shared with customers awhile back.
    As you may have seen recently on social media, we&#x27;ve built a number of alphas and are currently testing those to 
further mature the design.
    And while those point out a few key additions like rear steer.
    There are also a number of smaller or less visible improvements, though the product is largely true to the initial 
vision.
    We&#x27;ll continue to work through the product in the beta stages that we&#x27;re in now and look to launch that by next 
year.

    Overall, I am very proud of what the team has accomplished, and I&#x27;m excited for our next phase of growth into Q4 and
into <span class="r2">2022</span>.
    The team has done a tremendous job improving our financial health in a short period of time, while also continuing 
to improve our precision and pace of execution.
    Thank you.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    And we will now take questions from institutional and retail shareholders that we posted on our website.
    The first question is, when should we expect the first vehicles to be delivered with <span class="r2">4680</span> cells?
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, thanks, Martin.
    Earlier next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural battery crash, range, and reliability testing are on 
track to be complete this quarter.
    Testing to-date has gone well, and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support.
    However, similar to what Zach said before, this is a new architecture, and unknown unknowns may exist still.
    Our top priority is ensuring quality in what we deliver.
    And from a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness, matching the 
pack timeline I just mentioned.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The second question from institutional investor comes, do you still expect to start production of the $</span><span class="r4">25</span><span class="r4">,</span><span class="r4">000</span><span class="r4"> model </span>
<span class="r4">in </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4">.</span>
    What are the biggest hurdles from now until then?
    Lars Moravy

Yeah, we&#x27;re working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly as possible.
    I think Zach spoke to that well.
    And we&#x27;re doing this while trying to add the least amount of incremental complexities to the business.
    We don&#x27;t want to add any new vehicles to our lineup when we&#x27;re generally in a cell constrained world.
    While there is still more runway to grow these existing products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin and 
Berlin, ramping S&amp;X further in Fremont to restore to past levels, while also growing <span class="r2">3</span> and Y production in Fremont and 
Shanghai.
    As we&#x27;ve mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will be Cybertruck.
    And that time and course depend on increasing cell capacity, both from our suppliers and through our inherent cell, 
as well as many other headwinds we face in supply chain, and completing our currently full plate of products on the 
table.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you very much.
    The third question is, with FSD Beta training dataset set to explode exponentially as software is released to a 
wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed 
out from biweekly to weekly or even daily?
    Lars Moravy

At this point, it&#x27;s not so much about how much data can we collect, but how quickly can we process the data we&#x27;ve 
collected.
    This is where Dojo comes in as we mentioned on AI Day with substantially faster training computer.
    In Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do now.

    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell, particularly progress towards 
performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?
    Thank you.
    Unidentified Company Representative

Sure thing, Martin.
    <span class="r2">4680</span> cell production in Texas increased <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    Congrats to the Texas team for producing their <span class="r2">20</span> million cell off of line one.
    Texas is now our primary <span class="r2">4680</span> facility.
    We’re heavily focused on quality.
    Scrap is down <span class="r2">40</span>% quarter-over-quarter.
    With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the 
quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals.
    And that is our priority.
    The Cybertruck cell with <span class="r2">10</span>% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This quarter we convert to building a </span><span class="r4">100</span><span class="r4">% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four </span>
<span class="r4">lines in Phase </span><span class="r4">1</span><span class="r4"> over the next three quarters.</span>
    Phase <span class="r2">2</span> of the Texas <span class="r2">4680</span> facility is currently under construction.
    The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase <span class="r2">1</span>, and our target is for them to start
producing in late <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs.
    Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities,
enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
    A – Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The next question from institutional investors.
    Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the
opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
    A – Unidentified Company Representative

Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser 
focus on efficiency improvement.
    As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production 
volume.
    For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of 
the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there.
    That’s what I can share for now.
    Elon Musk

In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items.
    But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico 
factory.

    Rod Lache

Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took.
    You’ve taken now about $<span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> out of the average vehicle costs over the past year.
    Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the 
factory changes you alluded to?
    Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here?
    And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next-gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked 
about earlier this year?
    Vaibhav Taneja

Yes.
    So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this.
    There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control.
    We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.
    So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3.
    Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4.
    We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be.
    So, they will impact in the near term.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we </span>
<span class="r4">will be dealing with.</span>
    On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to 
predict precisely as to where we land.
    But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a 
daily basis.
    Unidentified Company Representative

I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional 
cost downs for <span class="r2">2024</span>.
    We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side.
    And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.
    Rod Lache

The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
    Elon Musk

Not at this time.
    Rod Lache

Okay.
    And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a 
vacuum.
    And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting 
the law of large numbers on some of your products.
    Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment?
    And any thoughts along those lines?
    Elon Musk

I think that there’s very significant price elasticity.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So margins out of the gate that are a little low, but are then used for the reg credits that help to offset that.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    But what I think, I would say generally to the question is, I mean, we&#x27;ve been in a position for sometime now where 
we are prioritizing where in the world we send our production.
    And there&#x27;s different factors to that depending upon when different product changes are made, what the logistics 
routing look like, different things going on in different markets.
    But we are in a position where we need to prioritize.
    I mean, what we&#x27;re trying to do as fast as we possibly can is get production up higher, so that we&#x27;re not in a 
position of needing to prioritize again.
    There are -- yes, I think that gets at the sentiment of your question.
    Martin Viecha

Okay.
    Let&#x27;s go to next question, please.
    Operator

Our next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.
    Please go ahead.
    Gene Munster

Good evening.
    A question on Semi.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; If you could just walk us through the development of Megachargers, platoon and maybe just how you think about </span>
<span class="r4">autonomy for Tesla Semi?</span>
    And what is -- how you envision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV?
    Elon Musk

Well, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?
    Jerome Guillen

Yes.
    We continue the development of the Semi.
    And in particular, Megachargers, we realized that <span class="r2">350</span>-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going 
to be enough for Semi.
    So we&#x27;re looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast the Semi 
as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break, yes.
    So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi.
    That&#x27;s the goal.
    We&#x27;re working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to be 
deployed for all customers.
    Yes.
    Probably, all I can say at this point, yes.
    We&#x27;re not working on<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

Sorry, go ahead.
    Jerome Guillen

Just we&#x27;re not working in isolation.

    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
    So, I view this as a structural -- a fundamental structural advantage of Tesla versus the rest of the auto industry.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Doing a bunch of work on the software side to omni diagnostics, identifying what needs to be done to before it comes 
into service, but also automating all of the preparation work and aligning all the resources that are necessary in order
for the car be very efficiently worked on once it arrives.
    So, the parts are there, like the lift is scheduled, the technician schedule, like everything do this was wrong with
me and tell the service center the carnage and everything.
    Everything ready in advance.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah, please fix me.
    And this is what&#x27;s wrong.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yeah.
    Instead of a customer trying to translate, the car is telling us directly, and we&#x27;re pulling that.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
    Most the time, you don&#x27;t need to diagnose the car when it arrives.
    The car -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of 
the auto industry.
    Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

I think it&#x27;s underappreciated as to what all we are able to do.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s why -- because like I said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same, so people </span>
<span class="r4">don&#x27;t realize that it has so much capability.</span>
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

But they look better than other cars, but they&#x27;re not like obviously super futuristic.
    Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    The next question is, please provide an update on the Semi.
    What will the next stage growth look like and when will FSD be ready?
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Sure.
    So, as you -- we posted in the earnings we&#x27;re progressing swiftly on the build of the Semi factory, our data factory
in Reno.
    We&#x27;ve released all our major cash flow expenditures for that program, and we&#x27;re on track to start pilot builds in 
the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of <span class="r2">2026</span> and ramping really throughout the year 
to full production.
    Semi growth will largely depend on our customers&#x27; adoption of the product.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to be limited, honestly.
    Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Which I can say -- which is like a no-brainer for the Semi because it&#x27;s really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
    Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes, exactly.
    We have kind of ridiculous demand for the Semi.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">22</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">1880</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2023]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they 
simply cannot afford it.
    And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in 
revenue, but in unit volume.
    If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than
our car.
    So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here.
    I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising.
    I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front.
    I don’t think it’s nothing.
    But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help.
    So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it 
for any amount of money or they can’t afford it.
    So, this is big deal.
    Martin Viecha

The next question is, when do you expect Model <span class="r2">3</span> Highland to be available in the U.S.?
    I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls.
    So let’s go to the next one.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver </span><span class="r4">2.3</span><span class="r4"> million vehicles in </span><span class="r4">2024</span><span class="r4">, representing </span><span class="r4">28</span><span class="r4">% growth </span>
<span class="r4">versus </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4"> guidance.</span>
    Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in <span class="r2">2024</span>?
    And when does Tesla expect to return to its <span class="r2">50</span>% long-term CAGR?
    Vaibhav Taneja

When we look at <span class="r2">2024</span>, there are a lot of moving pieces.
    I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment.
    So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our 
options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of <span class="r2">50</span>% forever, or you
will exceed the mass of the known universe.
    I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next question is do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the robotaxi driven or non-driven?
    What excites you most about how this project is progressing?
    Elon Musk

Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven.
    I guess, I’m very excited about our progress with autonomy, the end-to-end, nothing but nets self-driving software 
is amazing.

    Elon Musk

Thank you, Martin.
    So just to do a Q3 recap.
    Q3 was another record quarter on many levels.
    We had our industry-leading operating margin reach <span class="r2">17</span>%.
    And our free cash flow surpassed $<span class="r2">3</span> billion in Q3 and approached $<span class="r2">9</span> billion in the past <span class="r2">12</span> months.
    As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4.
    So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year.
    So, Q4 is looking extremely good.
    On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> cars made in a week with very good quality 
and is ramping rapidly.
    Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon.
    And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be <span class="r2">2</span>,<span class="r2">000</span>.
    Our production of <span class="r2">4680</span> cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter.
    We are finally gaining rapid traction on the <span class="r2">4680</span> cell.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant </span>
<span class="r4">portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.</span>
    We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for <span class="r2">4680</span> cells in Texas, which continues to show great
progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.
    The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3.
    And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.
    Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our 
Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.
    Our vehicles have now driven nearly <span class="r2">60</span> miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow 
exponentially.
    Our goal with that AI Day was to  <span class="r10">(</span>ph<span class="r10">)</span> recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial 
intelligence engineer and scientist resume.
    So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world.
    I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI 
technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.
    So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America.
    So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program 
this year, probably about a month from now.
    So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will 
immediately have that available to them.
    So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re
seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.
    Let’s see, with respect to demand.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">24</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">461</span><span class="r3">, TSLA_Q3_2020]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And that&#x27;s the goal with the Cybertruck.
    So, there&#x27;s like a lot of small improvements compared to what was unveiled.
    I think it&#x27;s going to be better than what we showed.
    And yes, it&#x27;s cool.
    Like it&#x27;s very made in Austin.
    So depending on completing that factory.
    And there are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.
    This is -- never been done before, so there&#x27;ll probably be some challenges along the way.
    And obviously, something that&#x27;s extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficult to form.
    So it&#x27;s -- there&#x27;s manufacturing challenges there.
    That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cleaner.
    Although it also looks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.
    Yes.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; If it goes well, we&#x27;ll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next -- towards the end of next </span>
<span class="r4">year, yes.</span>
    So it&#x27;s difficult to predict.
    I would say there&#x27;s probably a lot of deliveries in <span class="r2">2022</span>, and some deliveries towards the end of next year, if 
things go well.
    Pierre Ferragu

Okay.
    And now I&#x27;m trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like.
    So if I look at your production capacity at the end of this year, it&#x27;s going to be almost <span class="r2">850</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> units on an 
annualized basis.
    And you&#x27;re going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin.
    You say today you would open Austin as well.
    So you&#x27;re probably going to end the year above <span class="r2">1</span> million units.
    And so am I right thinking next year we should expect to deliver like somewhere like between <span class="r2">840</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> and <span class="r2">1</span> million 
cars during the year?
    Drew Baglino

Yes.
    We&#x27;ll<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

Go ahead, Drew.
    Drew Baglino

Yes, we&#x27;ll provide guidance on <span class="r2">2021</span> after next earnings call.
    Elon Musk

    When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”

Unidentified Company Representative

I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck.
    We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year.
    We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing<span class="r5">...</span>

Elon Musk

When should I drop my beta?
    Unidentified Company Representative

In a few weeks.
    That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into <span class="r2">2023</span>.
    Elon Musk

Great.
    Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick.
    That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.
    Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply 
chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
    Martin Viecha

Right.
    Thank you.
    Elon Musk

Of course.
    There’s Tesla Semi, of course.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st.</span>
    I’ll be there in person.
    And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck.
    That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, <span class="r2">500</span>-mile range.
    Just to be clear, <span class="r2">500</span> miles with the cargo.
    Yes, <span class="r2">500</span> miles with the cargo on level ground.
    Yes, sure.
    Not up.
    It’s excellent.
    But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo.
    And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck.
    And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look 
at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.
<span class="r6">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>

    So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like <span class="r2">150</span>% to <span class="r2">200</span>% a 
year, faster than cars by a lot.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Just to add before you jump in, Martin.
    Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where 
our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our 
capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup.
    So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.
    And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has 
mentioned.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
    And we try to model out like, let’s say, <span class="r2">2023</span> is a brutal recession year.
    Even then, we generate meaningful cash.
    Once you get out of that…

Martin Viecha

Great.
    Thank you very much.
    And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the
second platform with <span class="r2">3</span> and Y, led to a <span class="r2">50</span>% reduction in cost of goods sold.
    When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released?
    And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; Elon Musk</span>

<span class="r4">Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team,</span>
<span class="r4">obviously.</span>
    At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi.
    So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about
the cost of <span class="r2">3</span> and Y platform.
    It will be smaller, to be clear.
    But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.
    I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, <span class="r2">3</span>, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into 
that platform.
    But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a <span class="r2">2</span>-for-<span class="r2">1</span> target.
    So, we’re trying to get to that <span class="r2">50</span>% number again.
    It’s like, we’re going to take two.
    That’s exactly what  how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model <span class="r2">3</span>.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes.
    Effort costs.
    Elon Musk

Yes…

Zachary Kirkhorn

Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
    Elon Musk

We’re twice the output.
