[TSLA_Q4_2023] How did Tesla's strategy for Cybertruck development evolve between its 2019 unveiling and its production start in 2023â€“2024?

1. [Sentence #465] [SCALE ACHIEVED]
     We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner.
     Certainly, we're happy to, except on the supercharger front.
     We're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our supercharger network.
     We're also happy to license full self-driving, perhaps license other technologies, and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
     Dan Levy

Hi.
     Good evening.
     Thank you for taking the questions.
     First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform.
     You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain.
     Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.
     And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries.
>>> To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
     Lars Moravy

Yeah, I don't think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.
     We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle.
     When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out.
     You don't just throw it on the line and just build it.
     So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.
     Sure, 48 volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well.
     We're also open to partnering.
     Elon Musk

Yeah.
     48 volts.
     Lars Moravy

On that if everyone wants to do that.
     Elon Musk

Certainly.
     Man, the people that really know that this is like the inside baseball thing.
     But man, 48, it's so high time that the water industry moved from the 12 -- the random number of 12 volts to 48 volts.

2. [Sentence #113] [PLAN]
     This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024.
     This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in Lathrop.
     I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.
     Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows.
     As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase.
     For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives.
     Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion.
     We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.
     Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey.
     We can open it up to questions, Martin.
     Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     Let's go through investor questions.
     Question number one is from Michael.
>>> Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
     Elon Musk

I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic.
     I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time.
     But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025.
     So sometime in the second half.
     That's just what our current schedule says.
     But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.
     The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line.
     This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
     And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere.
     So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
     That will be a challenging production ramp.
     Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically.
     In fact, not practically.

3. [Sentence #214] [PLAN]
     And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car.
     It's pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.
     Martin Viecha

Okay.
     Thank you.
     The next question is, does the company anticipate a 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either of 2024 or 2025?
     If not, why not?
     Vaibhav Taneja

As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before.
     We are between two major growth waves.
     The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform.
     In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of the next generation vehicle.
     Martin Viecha

All right.
     Thank you very much.
     The next question is from Michael.
>>> When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
     Karn Budhiraj

We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects.
     But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction.
     Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
     Elon Musk

Yeah, exactly.
     It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly.
     I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many.
     And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3.
     So a much easier situation.
     And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin.
     And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
     Elon Musk

I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses.

     We will be.
     But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world.
     It's next level.

     Martin Viecha

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast.
     My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives.
     Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 pm Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
     During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.
     These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
     Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
     During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
     Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.
     But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
     Elon?
     Elon Musk

Thank you.
>>> So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023.
     We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance.
     And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year.
     This is really a phenomenal achievement.
     Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars.
     This is a record.
     In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America.
     And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area.
     It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps.
     And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area.
     What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.
     Think about that.
     It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world.
     And it's enriched the community in so many different ways.

     This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing.
     And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere.
     So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year.
     That will be a challenging production ramp.
     Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically.
     In fact, not practically.
     We will be.
     But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world.
     It's next level.
     So it's always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like.
     So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially.
     So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don't know.
     It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year.
>>> We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.
     Martin Viecha

Thank you.
     The next question is from Michael again.
     What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to get there?
     Elon Musk

Karn?
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I've seen some people commenting about that.
     To date, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory.
     And the goal is to keep it that way, not only for Cyber, but for our future vehicle programs.
     And as Elon said, it is an S-curve here too.
     It's hard to predict these things, but I'm just describing our goals.
     Elon Musk

It's a hard problem.
     Karn Budhiraj

Yeah.
     Elon Musk

There are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells.
