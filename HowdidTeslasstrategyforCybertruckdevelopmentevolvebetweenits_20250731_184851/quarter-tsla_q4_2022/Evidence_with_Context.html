start in <span class="r2">2023</span>–<span class="r2">2024</span>?

<span class="r3">1</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">90</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.
    As we look towards <span class="r2">2023</span>, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.
    There are three key points I wanted to make here.
    First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high.
    Second, on cost reduction, we&#x27;re holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead 
efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.
    In particular, we&#x27;re accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where 
efficiencies are the highest.
    But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of 
COVID-related instability.
    This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as 
an example.
    As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our 
suppliers on this journey as well.
    In that, we&#x27;ve priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure.
    Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term.
    However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.
    Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation </span>
<span class="r4">vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.</span>
    We&#x27;re looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month.
    Thank you.
    Question-and-Answer Session

A - Martin Viecha

Thank you very much, Zach.
    Let&#x27;s now go to investor questions.
    The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less 
than half of production in the fourth quarter.
    This has raised demand concerns.
    Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates?
    I think…

Elon Musk

We already answered that question.
    Martin Viecha

Yes, exactly.
    Elon Musk

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">2</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">231</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r6">[SCALE ACHIEVED]</span>
    And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high.
    So we&#x27;ve actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of
repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla 
comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the 
intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention.
    So it&#x27;s giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just 
figuring out how to get -- if somebody&#x27;s cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small.
    They&#x27;re like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.
    But we&#x27;re actually solving how to get somebody&#x27;s car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.
    And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars.
    And we&#x27;re making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for
being repetitive.
    But it&#x27;s remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of 
spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost.
    So, if you&#x27;re waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you&#x27;ve got a month of having to 
rent another car.
    It&#x27;s extremely expensive.
    And of course, you&#x27;re missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive.
    So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?</span>
    Elon Musk

We do expect production to start, I don&#x27;t know, maybe sometime this summer.
    But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow.
    It increases exponentially, but it&#x27;s always very slow at first.
    So I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in start of production.
    It&#x27;s kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that&#x27;s next year.
    Andrew Baglino

Thank you.
    That&#x27;s great Elon.
    Like just to emphasize on that, we&#x27;ve started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA,
general assembly, body shops.
    We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Elon Musk

Yes, exactly.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
    Elon Musk

Yes.
<span class="r5">────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span>
<span class="r3">3</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">182</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    Thanks, Martin.
    First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla <span class="r2">4680</span> team for achieving <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> a week in Q4.
    It was no small feat.
    Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work.
    As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of 
commissioning and install.
    Really, our <span class="r2">2023</span> goal as a <span class="r2">4680</span> team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.
    Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory 
process yields up as much as possible.
    Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we&#x27;ll be well set up to -- for a major <span class="r2">4680</span> year in
<span class="r2">2024</span>.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> will most likely come first in Cybertruck.
    Is that still the current plan?
    Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> cars to Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>?
    Elon Musk

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; And to be clear, for </span><span class="r4">2023</span><span class="r4">, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into </span>
<span class="r4">next year.</span>
    So it&#x27;s an incredible product.
    I can&#x27;t wait to drive it personally.
    It will be the car that I drive every day.
    I actually just I&#x27;m wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass.
    And it&#x27;s just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it&#x27;s really special.
    So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware <span class="r2">3</span>, I don&#x27;t think that will be needed.
    Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> will not be as good as Hardware <span class="r2">4</span>, but I&#x27;m confident that Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> will so far exceed the average -- 
the safety of the average human.
    So what we&#x27;re aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let&#x27;s say, for argument&#x27;s sake if Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> can be, 
say, <span class="r2">200</span>% or <span class="r2">300</span>% safer than human, Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> might be <span class="r2">500</span>% or <span class="r2">600</span>%.
    It will be Hardware <span class="r2">5</span> beyond that.
    But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.
    But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware <span class="r2">3</span> with Hardware <span class="r2">4</span> is quite significant.
    So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.

<span class="r3">5</span><span class="r3">. [Sentence #</span><span class="r3">174</span><span class="r3">]</span> <span class="r2">[PLAN]</span>
    And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter 
and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them 
drive sales just as it has with Tesla.
    So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.
    Martin Viecha

Thank you.
    Let&#x27;s go to the next question.
    Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the <span class="r2">4680</span> ramp.
    What are the current roadblocks?

    The second question is in a similar vein.
    What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q <span class="r2">2023</span>, specifically in terms of order 
intake levels?
    We&#x27;ve answered that one as well.
    So let&#x27;s go to the next one.
<span class="r4">&gt;&gt;&gt; The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production </span>
<span class="r4">credits for battery cells packs?</span>
    So $<span class="r2">3</span>,<span class="r2">700</span> per long-range Model <span class="r2">3</span> and Model Y, it&#x27;s $<span class="r2">45</span> a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much 
does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
    Elon Musk

I&#x27;ll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some.
    Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant.
    You can do the math if we were to get anyone your <span class="r2">1</span>,<span class="r2">000</span> gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred 
gigawatt-hours, it&#x27;s very significant.
    So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing.
    And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we&#x27;re splitting the value of the credits.
    So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it 
probably will be very significant in the future.
    Zachary Kirkhorn

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we&#x27;re expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year.
    So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit.
    The regulations here are still influx and there continues to be updates so this is just our best understanding at 
the moment.
    But we think on the order of $<span class="r2">150</span> million to $<span class="r2">250</span> million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the 
year as our volumes grow.
    And part of the work we&#x27;re doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as 
Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla&#x27;s plans anyways.
    And so I think we&#x27;re pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.
