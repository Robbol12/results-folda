--- Evidence in Transcript Order ---
1. [Sentence #45]  So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using **FSD** beta.
2. [Sentence #66]  Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our **full** self-driving software and hardware to other car companies.
3. [Sentence #67]  And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla **FSD**.
4. [Sentence #84]  This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as **full** self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend.
5. [Sentence #168]  Have you considered allowing **FSD** transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of **FSD**?
6. [Sentence #416]  I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload **full** self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
