[TSLA_Q4_2024] From 2023 to 2024, did Tesla hit its milestones for FSD (Full Self-Driving) functionality rollouts as described in quarterly updates?

1. [Sentence #235] [PLAN]
     So, it's really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
     But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car -- allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were little concerned.
     But how many times did you have to be intervened for definite safety reasons?
     And you will find that that is currently very rare and over time, almost never.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yeah.
>>> What we're seeing is at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing Tesla full self-driving technology.
     What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart.
     And then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer.
     That's better than us selling CAD drawings.
     And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very -- otherwise, it's not worth the complexity.
     And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised full self-driving working throughout the United States.
     I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.

2. [Sentence #155] [UNCERTAIN]
     This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs and especially the grid-scale ones to and saying basically as much demand as we can possibly make.
     So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation, and we're building a third factory.
     So, we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible.
     Now there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to -- that were not robbing from 1 pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications?
     It can't go both into both so we have to make that trade-off, yes.
     But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time.
     So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla.
>>> And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised full self-driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than Atlas car, or the Model S or the Model 3 or Model Y.
     In fact, I think it probably will be viewed '25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.
     There is no company in the world that is as good in real-world AI as Tesla.
     I don't even know who's in second place.
     Like you say, like, who's in the second place for real-world AI?
     I would need a very big telescope to see them.
     That's how far behind they are.
     All right.
-----
3. [Sentence #349] [UNCERTAIN]
     We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously.
     People are still finding ways to distill larger models in the smaller models.
     So, we're not giving up on Hardware.
     We're still working on it.
     Just will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     Thanks.
>>> Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought full self-driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done.
     Now I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Elon.
     The next question, has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Sorry, Mike, go ahead.
     Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst

Yes, I can take it.
     Yes, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains.
     It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products.
-----
4. [Sentence #94] [UNCERTAIN]
     In fact, even $500 billion training compute in that situation will be quite a good deal.
     Yes, the future is going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure.
     We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history.
     So, yes, so the proof is in the pudding.
     So, we're going to be launching unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June.
     So, I talked to the team.
     We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in Austin in June.
>>> We already have Teslas operating autonomously unsupervised full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we'll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas.
     So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California, that we'll soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world, the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.
     And the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because, obviously, they want to collide at the same spot.
     The cars are actually programmed with where -- with what lane they need to park into to be picked up for delivery.
     So, the drive from the factory end of line to their destination parking spot and to be picked up for delivery to customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day.
     It's pretty cool.
     Like I said, these Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them in June in Austin.
     So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation.
-----
5. [Sentence #426] [UNCERTAIN]
     Or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, "Hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?"
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

SP1 Well, I mean, I think the predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate.
     And it's worth nothing that sometimes people say, Elon's always late.
     Well, actually, no, the problems of the media reports on when I'm late but never reports when I'm early.
     So, sure, I'm optimistic but I'm not that optimistic.
     There are many cases in past where actually we've been early such as completion of the Shanghai factory or the factory completion has generally been ahead of schedule, not behind.
     So, yes.
>>> But I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised full self-driving, fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year, as probably everywhere in America next year, at everywhere in North America, at least.
     I think in terms of next year, our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory.
     Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which that really needs to be addressed.
     This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.
     So, guys, there's too many reps in the field.
     For example, for us, just to release unsupervised full self-driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority.
     Then the Netherlands presents us to the EU in, I think, May.
     And there's like this EU country committee.
-----
6. [Sentence #529] [PLAN]
     Then as probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet.
     So, kind of like Airbnb, where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guestroom, add it to the Airbnb or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory.
     If you're traveling for a month, you can or whatever the case maybe you can let other people use your house.
     And then you can -- so that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any kinks.
     And a lot of it -- it's not like we're not splitting atoms here.
     It's just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works, especially that people can order the car, it comes to the right spot, does exactly the right thing, all the payment systems work, the billing works.
     Yes.
>>> Pierre Ferragu -- Analyst

But then so my follow-up question would be, I have a Tesla, I have FSD, and I have to keep my eyes on the road all the time.
     It's super boring because I don't really need to intervene anymore.
     And the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails.
     And so, are you working also on introducing like a kind of like free unsupervised where I could be eyes off, and I would be able to check my email and would just need to, with a five-second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on what's happening?
     Or is that something you're working on as well because it feels so close with that I wonder if it's something we could expect for this year.
     It's a very selfish question I ask for myself, to be honest.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     We need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we are able to check their email and text messages.

7. [Sentence #378] [PILOT]
     Your life might depend on it.
     And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to help you because their computers don't work because the power went out and you can't charge your phone.
     Actually, happens over time.
     You literally can't even call anyone because your phone's out.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Thank you very much.
     The next question was covered in opening remarks so we will skip that.
     And the last question from say.com.
>>> What technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given that V13 already covered to control?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, we're going to have a whole let further than photons to output.
     We've been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but nets from photons to controls for a while now for just improving the neural nets.
     I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree.
     I have to say I continue to be amazed by just how effective auto-aggressive transformers are at solving a wide range of problems.
     I mean, Ashok, is there anything you'd like to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets?
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

Things report on next already.
     continuing to scale the model size a lot.

8. [Sentence #174] [PLAN]
     As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records of vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro environment.
     We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes, both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.
     For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality, and our customers who helped us achieve this.
     Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business, and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years.
     This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs, which impacted ASPs.
     While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market.
     This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market.
>>> On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs than due to the recognition of FSD-related revenue in Q3 from feature releases.
     Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, driven primarily by material costs.
     This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y, for which we recently started taking orders in all markets.
     All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month.
     While we feel confident in our team's abilities to ramp production quickly, note that it is an unprecedented change, and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time.
     This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter.
     As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp-related costs, as is common in any launch but will be overcome as production is ramped.
     We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025.

     Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer

We want to avoid that.
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Yes.
     So, it's really from a -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution.
     But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car -- allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene, not where you wanted to intervene or were little concerned.

10. [Sentence #583] [PILOT]
     So, perhaps you could just talk about with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

So, I'm not sure I understand the question.
     We have a lot of cars.
     I mean, you've got millions of cars out there.
     Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software

So, is there a question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Go ahead, unmute yourself, Dan.
     Dan Levy -- Analyst

Yes.
>>> More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD?
     Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect

Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand.
     And now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example.
     That obviously has a short-term impact on output.
     But the problem we were saying with, in fact, we're talking that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call was we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another.
     That's the constraint on our output.
     Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations

Great.
     All right.
